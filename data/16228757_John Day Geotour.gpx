      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">I went for a stroll after work today and found a spot I was looking at from work.  Very interesting location and some nice views.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">To find this cache, you should start out by parking at the campground  at:  44:21.375N  118:48.300W  where there is plenty of parking, a few camping spots and an outhouse.  

This will be the best place to park your rig unless you have a higher clearance style ride. 

The hike from here will be around 7 - 8 miles, depending on your route at the trail head.  You will gain around 1800 feet from the campground to the high point of the hike.

Start walking up the dirt road, take the first uphill fork to the left and walk up the road until you get to the Pine Creek trailhead at:  44:21.096N 118:48.435W.  

Just before this trailhead,below the road, you will see the remains of an old mining era house/cabin.  Further around the corner past the trailhead are more of these places as well as the old Chambers Mine.

From here, you can either walk further around the road and follow the road up the hill towards the cache or head back to the trailhead and follow it around the hill.  The trail is the easier route to take as it switches back several times to gain elevation.  The road does not, it just goes straight up the hill.  They will merge further along the ridge top and again towards the end of the open ridge.  

There is a benchmark near the trail in the saddle as well.  H 40  is at: 44:19.826N  118:47.573, located at an old campsite area - Table camp.

This cache is named for the large White Bark Pine tree near the cache.
  
Huge.  Old.  Dying slowly (As we all are?) but is putting out a valiant effort to stay around as long as possible. (As we all should.)

Your looking for a 6 quart plastic shoe box that has been painted green.  Not real hard to find if you know where your looking for.  There is a logbook and a slew of goodies inside. Please sign the logbook and trade even or up.

Enjoy the stroll.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">What an EPIC journey!  This one has been loitering at or near the top of my unfound list for quite some time.  In fact I wasn't sure that I was ever going to attempt this one.  I studied the maps, took an assessment of my physical capabilities, and just resigned myself to letting this one go.  But alas, the great September weather begged me to venture out this morning.  I really didn't have a plan.  I just decided to drive up Pine Creek and see what happened.  I parked at the horse camp and went on foot from there.  Oh I seriously thought about turning around multiple times!  But I figured if I were to die while caching, why not here?  The first part of the trail wasn't too bad, at least it was semi-shaded.  Then once you break out of the timber, whoa boy!  Hello Mr. Sun, pretty much all the rest of the way to to the hide.  Luckily it wasn't too hot way up here and the occasional gusts of wind helped cool things down a bit.  When I got to the area of Table Camp, I could see the final daunting climb ahead.  Geesh, this logscaler doesn't mess around!  So crashing through the blowdown to get to the other ridge, I stumbled upon someone's tent.  Nobody around, and I never did see anyone else on my whole trip up and back.  The last push I was feeling a bit numb, but powered onward to to hide!  Yep, it truly has been over 3 years since the last find, not even an accidental finder has logged it.  I savored the moment but knew the journey was only half over!  Now I had to limp my sorry self back to the geo-rig!  I was definitely starting to feel it on the last few switchbacks down to the trailhead, glad I had my hiking poles with me to slow the decent, otherwise I might have ended up down the embankment somewhere never to be heard from again!  By the time I got back to my ride (6 hours later) I was way too sore to do a happy dance.  Glad to get this one checked off.  Now it will be interesting to see how long it goes until the next finder!  TFTH.</groundspeak:text>

I believe that every cache should be a good story. This cache is an homage to my childhood home. The family ranch, affectionately known as "Heard's Half Fast Holler". My parents bought the place in 1975, the year I was born, for a whopping $29,000.00. The cache is not at the ranch, due to safety and privacy concerns, but if you want to see the Holler just head up Izee Route and it's the first house past the JBarL.</groundspeak:long_description>

Mr. acfunk was our driver today and we had a blast finding caches with them and meeting other geocachers along the way.   We loved the route as it took us over land that we have not seen before.  We ended up getting 19 of the 20 coin caches and got our geocoin.  Love the train on the back.  We were able to pick up a few caches that were not a part of the geocoin challenge too.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">At this location you will find a body of water which is presently owned by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife.  The property is on US Forest Service land.  Built in 1963 and repaired in 1966, this dam  is presently the subject of a $250,000 study to determine the feasibility of repair.  Community support has been vocal and strong in favor of repair as this location provides summer recreation and has historical value to many residents of the area.

Located at 5000 feet on the southwest slope of the Strawberry Mountains, this is a scenic spot and one can see various animals  enroute.  The actual structure you find at this location is interesting and presents questions as to the original construction and how repairs would be made.   The final decision of ODFW regarding this site should be made in October.

You are looking for an ammo can which contains various valuable items normally found in a cache.  This area is typically not used much so you will  not have a lot of observers except maybe for some folks doing the study.  A good opportunity to educate them on geocaching.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is located near the top of Little Canyon Mtn., 5762', southeast of Canyon City.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;I've contemplated taking a trip up here for quite some time.  With the disturbing lack of snow for February, I decided today was the day.  I encountered almost no snow at this elevation (still muddy in places), very unusual for this time of year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a jeep track leading to just below the summit, followed by a steep ATV track to the top, but for those with town cars or wanting a bit more exercise, you can park and walk as far as you want from the cache!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll be rewarded with an airline view of Canyon City and surrounding areas.  If you time it right and arrive by 12pm, you can hear the noon sirens in both Canyon City and John Day.  You'll also encounter lots of mining pockets and remnants scattered about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a clear, plastic nut jar.&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We decided to take a day trip down from the Tri-Cities to get this one and some others since the February weather has been so mild. Of course, the weather forecast we looked at was completely wrong since it was snowing pretty hard from Battle Mtn. almost all the way down in the morning. Not snowing in John Day, but we could see some snow up where we were going. Parked near the "Reservoir Site" cache and had an enjoyable hike uphill from there. Skirted around quite a few mining pits, some looked like they may be recent and active claims. It was flurrying and a cold wind was blowing when we reached the top. While at the cache, the noon siren went off as advertised. Very nice views of town. Sort of strange looking down on the airport which sits on top of the hill on the other side of the valley. Thanks for putting this one here. Gets a fav from us. TN. L-SHOOT ME AROUND THE WORLD TB. TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Placed in memory of our beautiful kitty, Zoe.  She was left by a friend's mailbox when she was tiny and we adopted her in December, 2010.  On June 11, 2014, sometime early in the morning she was hit by a car on the highway in front of our house.  Someone was kind enough to move her to the side of the road.  This cache was created by our kids to honor her memory.  &lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;We chose this spot because we had been geocaching on this road the day before and noticed it as we went UP the mountain.  We all thought it would be a perfect hiding spot and provides a "value-added" smiley between established caches.  We enjoyed the Canyon Mountain Trail cache so much that we hope others will take the time to visit there and hope that this will give extra incentive to keep climbing.  It is located near one of the Canyon Mountain Trail 218 signs, where a secondary road connects to the main road.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is in a large Danish cookie tin that has been painted black.  In addition to the log and writing utensils in a ziploc bag, there is a good starter stash of toys and other non-toy items.  Paper items have been placed together in another ziploc to help keep them dry as well.   This is our first hide and we really hope you enjoy it!&lt;/p&gt;

We were coming through the area on our way to eastern Oregon after a fun weekend in the Tri-Cities WA area.  I was sufficiently shamed by a friend due to my not finding this one, so just had to clear my name, lol!  Things have changed a little since last year, and there are different and less things inside the larger building.  We even found a little brass, near the smaller dynamite shack (good mix - dynamite and shooting!).  There were some very ravenous bugs there, so we were happy to find the cache quickly and get back into the rig!  Cache is in good shape, I'm not sure how I overlooked it last year. [:I] Thanks 4 the cache, and keeping it going at least long enough for me to clear my name! [^]</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The cache container is a painted plastic jar with various valuable items. &amp;nbsp; Your best parking spot will be on the East side of the highway and I recommend you drive by the location and turn around at a safe turn around area. &amp;nbsp;I picked this &amp;nbsp;location because of it&amp;#39;s rough beauty and the various environments to be observed in the area. &amp;nbsp;The nearby creek is Canyon Creek which eventually runs into the John Day river. &amp;nbsp;The creek is running fairly full at present but goes from flooding parts of Canyon City in the spring of 2012 to being nearly dry during late summer. &amp;nbsp;Along this creek are patented gold claims and during the summer you will sometimes seek small dredges being used by claim owners. Today the creek was especially nice because of the green moss and the white waters flowing over the bolders. &amp;nbsp;Vegetation in the area consists of everything from weeds to elderberries and choke cherries; both of which make good wine and jelly. &amp;nbsp; A short distance to the North on the East side of the highway you will see a large rocked bank with a vein of quartz running down the front. &amp;nbsp;I have been told such a vein is where gold miners become excited as gold is often found in quartz. &amp;nbsp;Higher up you will see some large steel plates which have been bolted to the rock I assume for stability. &amp;nbsp;You may also find some animal bones in the area as &amp;nbsp;deer and cars in this area have some conflicts. &amp;nbsp;Cougars have also been spotted higher up off the road. &amp;nbsp;If you notice the traffic signs, you will conclude some folks need to go to the rifle range but unfortunately shooting roadside signs in common place in Eastern Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Yikes!  That's the toughest 1.5 terrain I've ever done.  I'd call it a 3 at least.   Kar stayed on the road, while Lee made the straight shot up through the trees.  He got there before I did, but barely, and he had a few ticks take up residence while I came away unscathed.  When the road ended, I had to figure out which route was the least difficult to get to the top.  I'm not sure I chose the best, but one scratch on one leg from one rock isn't too bad I guess.  
Now, the view makes that hike all worth it, so don't pack it in just because its NOT a "quick walk up".  Yes,  you will have to do a bit of rock climbing no matter which direction you come from.  I think I had a few more rocks, while he had the tougher climb.  Its a toss-up really.
I do wish I knew what the elevation gain was from the car to the top, but I have an iphone and it doesn't give me all that good stuff.  Sigh.

Took the mardi-gras beads, left a few kid trinkets.

The last part was a scramble up the hill, I told Hamsx2 she should give me the pin, as she might not want to go to the the cache. Well she beat me to the top and the James Bond sumitcache and the Geocache.

We drove in from 395 and saw some smoking trees and thought we should go to the fire tower first but since it is suppose to get hot we changed our minds and we did our hiking first. The walk up was nice early this morning. Once we had walked up to the last bit he said hand me a pen and he would go up. haha. I not only kept the pen but I beat him up to the top, found the cache and was signing the log before he made it up. I also beat him down using what I called a mountain goat trail. It was rather narrow.

Another day after work with nothing to do but get out and enjoy another location on the Malheur National Forest.

This is a real easy location to get to from John Day or Burns.

Hang a South East off of Highway 395 onto the Starr Ridge Road - USFS Rd. # 196.  Travel about 8.15 miles to the tower compound.  

If the gate is shut please leave it that way.  

While here, visit with Sandra and sign here logbook as well. If she is on duty that is.  

If you go up the tower, Be very careful of the 70 steps to the top.  Very steep. Duck your head when first entering the stairwell also.

This area is due for some thinning soon to open up the view for the lookout.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Perfect day for a drive up the mountain!  Stopped at Sugarland on the way up - half expected that to be one of YOUR caches after we were done there.  Turns out this one was easy to walk to and easy to find.  Nice going!  
The grounds up here are really well kept too, that was a surprise.  And restrooms?  Up here?  WOW.  They were locked of course, but another month and they'll be open.  Very cool.
Of all the bumpy backroads we've been on lately, this was a nice reprieve.  We came in from the north (Starr Ridge Rd.) and went out the south towards Seneca.  The north route is slightly nicer, but only because there's a few moguls along the south route.  Either way, the drive was easy.  Even a town car could do this.  
One downside - the ticks are out in full force right now.  We took the geo-pup with us and she came home with a few of them which she happily shared.  Shudder.    Hubby picked up a few too.  I managed to avoid them until one found my yarn that was stashed near the pup.  My mistake. 

Forgot to mention:  today starts year 2 of our geocaching adventures.  376 found since 4/30/14.  Let's hope today's finds get us moving on another great year!

We made a quick stop at Sugarloaf to grab the cache there and headed on.  Found the cache, then started chatting with the folks at the LOT. Mike was great, we talked and received some good advice about life. He invited both Hamsx2 &amp; myself to the top of the LOT, what a view. Thanks to Mike and thanks to the CO for bring us here.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;If you have found some of the Canyon City-John Day Geocoin Kickoff Event hides, you may have seen a different environment than this location.  You are in Eastern Oregon where various activities are enjoyed.  This property is BLM land and is used for off road motorcycle, target practice and, from the appearance of the beer cans, an occasional party. The area is monitored, well that was the plan, by the Grant Count Off Road group.  A few years ago the area was so trashed it required a full day of clean up with several vehicles hauling off all sorts of trash.  There were previous complaints by neighbors regading activities, car noise and parties, and BLM began to attempt to place controls on activities.  The rusty guard rails and signs are about as far as they got in that regard.  Feelings during the dispute were strong and one neighbor experienced poisoning of his well and it is believed it may have been as a result of his expressed concerns about the behavior of those using the area.  That family has since left the area and the criminal investigation appears to be going nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a painted plastic container with various items of interest.  In the lid is a CODE WORD which is to be recorded on the event sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">UPDATE 8/15/2006 Cache is still there.

Please note that the cache is NOT on the west side of the top, and is NOT in a dangerous location. It is just hard to find unless you have the clue or a GPS unit that is stabilized for at least 30mins for a more accurate reading.

Two Ways one Easy one Not so Easy.

Trail Head is near the End of Forest Service 1640. From Seneca take Road 16 East to 1640 Road to High Lake.
Trail Head is 1/4mile before High Lake Parking lot.
The trail is suitable for most folks who are used to normal back country hiking trails. 

Side Trip:
Go .2 miles hang a right for 200ft and check the view. Watch for cliffs. Then after .9 miles hang another right for 300ft to check out a NEW view. 

The first 2.25 miles are fairly even with minor elevation changes. The last mile will require some work, the trail is well defined. Once you reach the top the view is awesome. Cache is in a small blue can, with a plastic lid. Total.. 3.4 miles with 1390ft elevation change.

Hard Way.
Take 60 road south from Prairie City to Trail Head at Strawberry Lake Campground. Hike 5.2 miles with 3435 feet of elevation climb. Has a great waterfall on the way. And you can take a side trip to Little Strawberry Lake.

NOTE:On failure to find cache. Cache is not in an area that makes it a danger to get to. It is hidden fairly well.
The hint should be taken along. This should make it really easy to find it. If no luck then I am afraid someone may have removed it. I plan to go there in late August to either replace or find.</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Found it on a beautiful day for hiking.  Wildflowers were everywhere.  A new container is needed for the cache, or at least a new lid. The plastic is weathered and cracked around the edges, and the items inside are somewhat damp--except the log.  It's dry inside the zip-lock bag.
By the way, several sources list the hike as 3.25 miles.  Tracing the trail on the USGS topo map actually indicates 3.5 miles, for a 7.0 mile round trip.  Additionaly, my Garmin 60CSx (a sophisticated GPS) takes account of all the trail's ups and downs, and shows a 7.27 mile round trip; so the actual hiking distance is more like 3.6 miles one-way, taking no shortcuts.
Also, the trailhead altitude is 7,868 ft and the summit is 9,038 ft, so the nominal elevation gain is 1,170 ft.  However, the GPS also measures each "up" in the trail, and the result is a total "ascent" elevation gain of 1,678 ft.  That figure divided by 3.6 miles gives an overall elevation gain of 466 ft per mile from trailhead to summit.  A nice workout!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Another cache in the "My Home" series. This one pays homage to another one of my favorite childhood spots, one that is no longer avilable to enjoy anymore. The bridge at the end of Humboldt Street was right at the foot of Grandma &amp; Grandpa Campbells driveway. Back in the early '80's when I was a first and second grader at Humboldt Elemntary School, there was no XBox or internet to keep us busy. The only station we seemed to get here in Canyon City was WTBS from Atlanta, who knows why, and you could only watch "The Rokford Files" so many times. So the bridge was my own playground. Fishing, wading, building dams, throwing sticks upstream and running to the other side of the bridge to throw sticks at them were my past time. Home is always where the heart is.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;You are now in Canyon City which was founded on June 8, 1862.  The town was established as a result of gold being found and in 1862  miners removed 26 million dollars worth of gold from the area. During the gold rush, the town was dominated by many gold miners and had a population of around 10,000 with 2,000 being chinese.  This cache is found on Rebel Hill and at this locaton you will see a large building, now a residence, on the hill which used to be the Canyon City school.  The school housed grades 1 thru 8 and also had a high school.  On February 22, 1909 the Canyon City school published a newspaper called "Joaquin Cabin".  The proceeds from the first edition were to be used to apply towards the purchase of the school piano.  The paper sold for 10 cents a copy.&lt;/p&gt;
Now, the building you see is actually the second school building as the first was a single level and has since been replaced by the present building.
&lt;p&gt;A little towards the North is a residence which was the filming location in the early 1970's of a movie "Napolen and Samantha" with Michael Douglas and Jody Foster.  Much of the community were involved as "seconds" and scenes were shot around the county. &lt;span style="line-height:1.6;"&gt;You are looking for a painted plastic container with various items of little value.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6;"&gt;This cache is one of 20 included in the Canyon City-John Day Geocoin Kickoff event scheduled for June 21, 2014.  Cachers finding 15 of the 20 hides will receive a trackable geocoin.  One coin per family until 100 are gone.  Those cachers unable to attend the event can obtain a listing sheet at the Grant County Chamber of Commerce, N 44 24.993, W118 57.273, 24/7.and can return the completed sheet at one of the locations listed below to receive a coin.  We are unable to mail coins. We will also include a cache listing on the event site.  Each cache will have a CODE WORD noted in the lide of the container.  Please record the code word on you work sheet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6;"&gt;Monday-Friday 9:00-4:00 Grant County Chamber of Commerce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The final container is located at:

You're looking for a small, clear plastic snapware container.

Daylight hours only, please.

I hope this new cache inspires others to hide some new caches in the area [:D].

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This small ammo can is located at the edge of Grant County Road 78.  The cache contains the usual swag that is probably geared a little more towards children however an adult may have to retrieve the cache container since the terrain is a little tricky.  From the cache site there is a pretty good view of Miller Mt. and Little Canyon Mt.  There is also a fair overlook of Canyon City.  The traffic here is usually light.

Congratulations to osage2 for the first to find!</groundspeak:long_description>

You are looking for a painted plastic jar with various goodies.  I hope you appreciate the view from here and just think  how it looks to small children with a sled once they reach the top. Guess how it looks to the parents seeing them wipe out coming down!!</groundspeak:long_description>

In fact, the closest one is 135 road miles away in Ontario, Oregon.  The next closest is 139 miles away in Redmond, Oregon.  Who really knows how far this cup really traveled.

This got me to thinking about how people and things get from place to place and how many miles I've driven pursuing this geocaching hobby, but how many places I've seen that I otherwise wouldn't have noticed.

The container and all the contents I'm starting this cache with are from previous hides I've had over the years.  You're looking for a camo-painted lock-n-lock.</groundspeak:long_description>

Just couldn't understand the Pictures on the cache page. After finishing Dry Soda early we decided to try it. Imagine my surprise when Hamsx2 advice (contrary the Nuvi)  We came upon an antenna farm and a LOT that I could not see on Google Earth. We checked the Handheld GPS and discovered this must be a "grandfathered LOT Cache".  From the LOT we could see a FM broadcast tower (KJDY) so we drove to it. We could have driven further but decider not to for fire potential reasons. As usual Hamsx2 located the cache first but jumped back and screamed. I thought snake, but no it was "Big Bird"  taking flight, and returning to hunting. 
Thanks for our last LOT of the day.</groundspeak:text>

We didn't take the Nuvi's direction because I said stay on the gravel, it will get us there. Then we came across two brown forest service signs directing us along the way. Once we saw the tower we brought out our gps units to look for the cache. I first thought there must be two different towers since the cache was a ways away and I was already thinking what do I have in the truck to place another cache here. But then I realized there was only one tower and a cache by that name. Oh well! We hiked out the final distance after stopping the truck in a good location because of a hot truck and tall grass. Once I did the last little bit uphill I was ready to make the grab but I spooked up a hawk or some other BIG BIRD (not to be confused with the Sesame Street character) 10 feet from the cache, five feet from where I was standing. I screamed and jumped back almost landing on my backside. Hams2x thought I had seen a snake and was concerned but I was still trying to catch my breath before I could answer him. After that he offered to make the grab. He is so nice to me!!!

Thanks for another great hide!
Also - we took the Starr campground road back out - Much better than the lower entrance. </groundspeak:text>

Just make sure you are armed with the Bend airport CTAF when you try to open the door. &lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Cache is near the road, but the terrain is such that parking outside the airport fence and approaching from that way back to the road would would better. The terrain rating is based on that approach. A well camoed cache, that blends in well, but luckily there are not very many hiding places it can be here. Enjoy the natural camo and the views!.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Arriving at the listed coordinates should present no problem; however getting to the final cache requires a little bit of work but will allow you to spend more time in this beautiful location.  This cache experience will also educate your regarding this very beautiful and interesting creature.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache requires some math, total adherence to instructions and some patience in solving problems to obtain the complete coordinates to the final cache. I highly recommend a FLASH LIGHT be available. I think you will enjoy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must be observant of all numbers, excluding coordinates, you see once you begin the search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you arrive at the first stage of this short multiple you will find a large fairly common looking item which opens from the top and side.  There will not be a creature looking back at you thru the small window but , if you use the two probes and the visible screw  heads to complete an electrical (no danger) circuit you  will be  able to obtain the missing seconds for the W coordinate.  Please leave everything as you found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seconds to the N coordinate can be determined by completing some simple math using information from the short description below&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Aix sponsa is one of the most stunningly pretty of all waterfowl.  This area is not prime territory for this bird however they are found in parts of Oregon.  They are one of only a few waterfowl equipped  to grip tree bark and perch on branches.   The female typically lays from 7 to 15 eggs which hatch around 30 days later.  The day following hatching the young birds jump from their nest which can be as high as 50 feet off the ground.  Most babies survive this jump and immediately follow the mother to water.  This is a beautiful bird and I hope some day you will be able to see one.&lt;/p&gt;
By answering the following questions you will be able to obtain the final three digits of the North coordinate. What is the distance the babies jump from when leaving the nests? Multiply that number by the minimum number of eggs the female lays. How many numerals did you see? Multiply that number by the length of incubation. Add that answer to the previous multiplication question. What is the maximum number of eggs the female lays? Multiply that number by the only single digit number you found which is divisible by 2. Add that number to your previous addition answer. Now add 17 to your total and hopefully you have the correct three digits. You will find some small SWAG and a log book in the final cache.
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is one of 20 included in the 2015 Grant County Cachers Geocoin Kick Off Event (GC5QGMT) on June 13, 2015,  The theme is "Caching on the Rails". We have 150 coins minted and finding 15 caches will send you home with new smilies, a wonderful experience in beautiful country and a nice geocoin for you collection.  (One coin per family while available)&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;On August 28, 2012 a fire started at the Parish Cabin campground not far from this site.  The fire was determined to be human caused but no specifics were ever noted.  The fire grew to a little over 6000 acres quickly and required the evacuation of the camp ground and a few deer hunters had to find a new camping site.  As I recall there were some vehicles damaged in the fire.  The fire was fought by the Malheur National Forest crew, Oregon Department of Forestry and inmates from the correctional facility in Ontario, Oregon.  I find it interesting to see the edge of the fire  coming to the water and therefore the name of the cache.    Along the road you can see the burned area and now wood cutters have begun to salvage some of the trees for firewood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a painted container with various items for trading.  Please sign the log book and note the code word inside the container lid which must be included on the passport you will receive.  There is not much traffic on this road but be cautious when pulling over for this one.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is one of 20 included in the Canyon City-John Day Geocoin Kickoff Event for June 21, 2014.  Those cachers unable to attend the event can obtain a listing sheet at the Grant County Chamber of Commerce, N44 29.993, W118 57.273, and may return the completed sheets at (location to be determined.  Geocoins will be available  to the first 100 cachers finding 15 of the 20 caches.  Limit one coin per family.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;In the trees nearby  is the fire siren for the volunteer fire department of John Day. It appears quite old but is  totally functional and can really make the dogs howl.  If you happen to be in the area at high noon you will get an"ear full".  In Prairie City, about 13 miles from John Day, the city used to blow the siren at 9:00 to remind kids it was curfew  time on school nights.  I don't recall John Day ever having to remind John Day kids. To the West of this location on highway 395  you will see the present day John Day Fire Station which was built in 1953 and is still in use.The building is now in bad repair and is inadequate for present day equipment and training needs.  On May 20th, residents of John Day and the John Day Rural District will vote on a bond issue for $655,000 for capital costs related to a new station.  The total cost of the new station is $1.8 million. The new station will be located at the present site of the Mexican resturant just South of the present fire station. That property currently belongs to the city of John Day and was purchased in hopes of a new station being located there.  NEWS FLASH-On May 20, 2014 the voters passed the levi and the city will proceed to further planning.  Maybe they will get a new siren!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a painted plastic container containing the normal collection of useful items. If you are working the coin challenge, remember to  record the code word found inside the lid of the container.  While in the area enjoy the view and notice the brown trees to the north as they are evidence of the fire which surrounded the city of John Day in August of 2013. Thank you firefighters for keeping us safe.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Cache is located in John Day.  The terrain is basically level except for some wood chips near the cache.  Parking is close by and only a short walk to the cache.  You are looking for a garden related item with various items of little value.  This cache is part of the Canyon City-John Day Geocoin Kickoff  Event scheduled for June 21, 2014.  If you are participating in the event you will need to record the code word found in the lid of the container onto your work sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The progress you see in this area is about three years old and the site is provided to allow locals to achieve some level of independence from food obtained in the local grocery store.  The spot has increased in the number of beds each year and a significant amount of work has already been done this year.  &lt;/p&gt;
Very close to the cache is an item which is NOT an elevated Igloo dog house. I have never used this item but reports are it is very effective and does not require electricity or gas and is a means to enjoy items found within the fenced area. The area is interestiing and available for observation but please do not enter the garden area or open the oven.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This year's theme is "Caching On The Rails".  Although there are no longer any active rail lines in the county, there is a rich railroad history in the area. We also want to showcase the beauty that is Grant County Oregon!  The kickoff for the new 2015 Grant County Trackable Geocoin will be at 9AM, June 13th, at the Grant County Chamber of Commerce, 301 West Main Street, John Day.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;We'll have 20 all-new physical caches, each with a code word.  Find code words in 15 of the caches to claim the 2015 Geocoin (one per family). There will only be &lt;strong&gt;150 coins&lt;/strong&gt; minted!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the new caches will be published the morning of the event. This year's caches will be set up in a geotour style covering approximately 90 scenic miles. Please note that cell phone reception will be non-existent over most of the route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9AM - Event Kickoff - welcome and raffle; passport sheets will be handed out. For those using the geocaching app on their cell phone, you will need to download the caches prior to leaving town due to limited/non-existent cell reception over most of the route. For those with GPS units, we suggest bringing your laptop with you to download the GPX files for the caches. Free wi-fi is available at the Chamber office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chamber of Commerce office will be open until 4PM the day of the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5PM - let's gather at OUTPOST PIZZA PUB AND GRILL, 201 W MAIN in JOHN DAY to swap stories and have something to eat after a long day of caching. We'll start setting up at 4PM for the evening social and to give out coins to those who didn't get a chance to claim one earlier. There will be items to raffle here as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are unable to attend the kickoff event, log sheets will be available outside the Chamber of Commerce office. After the event, coins can be claimed at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grant County Chamber of Commerce, 301 West Main Street, John Day - Monday-Saturday 9AM-12PM and 1PM to 4PM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kam Wah Chung Visitor's Center, 125 NW Canton Street, John Day - Sunday 9AM-12PM and 1PM to 5PM. Geocoins must be picked up in person, we are unable to mail coins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please log a "Will Attend" so we know how many folks will be coming or "Write A Note" if you are not able to attend the Kickoff but expect to complete the requirements after the event during the summer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is a nice location to sit and people watch.  Looking to the East, you will see the Advent Christian Church, (known as the Seventh Day Adventist Church) which was built in 1898 and added to the National Register in 1992.  Behind the church you can find a historic marker commemorating the history of Canyon City and John Day.  If you are here on a weekday, this is a great place to pick up some information if you are traveling through Grant County.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I was scoping out new cache hiding spots today and thought I had a good one all ready to go, then I checked how far away it was from other caches and it turned out to be too close to another one.  This alternate hidey-hole is a fair hair-width just far enough away from the nearest cache.  Pretty amazing considering the sheer lack of geocaches around these parts.  Those who have hidden before me sure picked out some good spots!

You'll encounter very infrequent muggle traffic along the trail, but be heads up.  The neighboring area could be quite busy if any events are scheduled there.

You're seeking a camo-painted, round moisturizer creme container with reclaimed swag from some of my previous hides.  Recamo it well!

The cache is placed at an elevation of 4925 feet.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">You are seeking a painted plastic container which contains a log sheet, pencil and items of little value to adults but may excite some young cachers.  The cache site is one I was not aware of until I was in search of firewood and explored various roads in the area.  It is not necessary to cross the fence to get this cache and you would not want to disturb the young ones of nature.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">You likely will not find the exact location of the container very interesting, however to your west you will see a large fenced area which provides recreational opportunity to youth and adults in the area.  The newly completed double tennis court and basketball court are available because of the generosity of the community.  The nearby skate park was built with community fund raising and grant monies and many a youth has spent time learning new skills along with a few getting to visit the emergency room. This large area is managed by the John Day/Canyon City Recreation District and youth enjoy organized football, soccer and baseball along with an occasional trout from the pond.  Take a few minutes to make a lap on the walking path; you may even find you are close to additional caches.

&lt;p&gt;This is an internationally known museum and a tourist draw for John Day.  The museum is open only May thru October.  Guided tours only but no fee to enter.  Well worth an hour or so of ones time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a painted plastic container containing the usual valuable items.  If you are doing the Canyon City-John Day Geocoin Kickoff Event for June 21, 2014, remember to record the CODE WORD found in the lid of the container on to your challenge sheet. &lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Cache is just off of a forest service trail.  The cache name may have something in common with the trail name.  The trail is fairly primitive and the seeker will experience both a short climb in elevation and some obstructions on the trail.  You will be at an elevation of 5272 feet.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache was placed as I broke in a great pair of boots provided to me and several cachers by Nike.  We are involved in placing caches for the Wild Canyon Games staged each June at the Washington Family Ranch (Young Life ranch) near Antelope, Oregon.  The boots received a good break in as this cache was originally placed in a wilderness area and had to be relocated.  This placement in and out was a good four miles total.  The present cache is not in the wilderness but is in a senic location well worth a little extra hike even after finding the cache.  

My replacement of this cache was complicated by my hiking well over a mile on the  trail looking for a good placement location and realizing the container was no longer secured to my back pack.  A trip back to the truck revealed the container in the road so off I went again. 

The cache container relates to the title and you will know when you find it.  The actural container is a large PVC tube marked "geocache" which contains various items.  This is a family friendly cache.    Please replace the cache exactly as you find it.

During winter months this cache likely will not be accessible.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;We are pleased you stopped to geocache in John Day. This specific location is to provide rest for you and a chance to explore town if you widh.  It is a good location for a cache and I think you will find the hunt to be fairly easy.  You are looking for a painted plastic container with the usual SWAG. Read below about the CODE WORD in the lid of the container.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is one of 20 included in the Canyon City-John Day Geocoin Kickoff Event scheduled for June 21, 2014. Cachers finding 15 of the 20 will receive a trackable geocoin. One per family limit until the 100 coins are gone. Those cachers unable to attend the event can obtain a listing sheet at the Grant County Chamber of Commerce, N 44 24.993,, W118 57.273, and can return the completed sheet at a location to  be determined to receive their geocoin.  We will attempt to also include a cache listing at this site.  I will log a note as to the availability of coins.  We are unable to mail coins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This location in the past was a rough and often unsitely spot for folks to experience as they came to John Day.  Last year some generous community minded individuals took on the task of making this spot more attractive and purposeful.  The area was graded and graveled and no longer acted like a swimming pool when it rained.  Ducks have been seen in the pool!  To the South the weeds were removed and grass planted.  The "sign" at the tree was erected with plans for it being a mini information center.  One primary goal for the area was to provide a parking option for large trucks and campers to allow folks an opportunity to park and explore town.  The area does get good use and I know the business to the West has enjoyed more activity.  We hope you will also get some rest here and enjoy geocahing in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a painted plastic container with the usual SWAG and a log book. If you are doing the coin challenge, please include the CODE WORD found on the inside of the lid on your work sheet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The SIGNS OF OUR TIMES is a cache that will test your knowledge of GPS and test your ability to focus.&lt;br /&gt;
This may not be as much works as it seems - most of it can be done without leaving the comfort of your vehicle. Some folks are finding it and some aren't, but it's there.        &lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;First, some definitions.  On a sign post at the coordinates you will find one or more signs.        &lt;br /&gt;
You must consider all the signs on the post as one sign.          &lt;br /&gt;
If there are any duplicates characters or numbers, treat them as if they weren't duplicated.&lt;br /&gt;
If you see 43 and 26, this is two NUMBERS that add to 69 and there are 4 numeric characters that add up to 15.    &lt;br /&gt;
If you see 44 and 22, this is two NUMBERS that add to 66, and 4 numeric characters that add up to 12.&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
At each stop:        &lt;br /&gt;
The number of alpha characters is A.  The number of numbers is B, the number of numeric characters is C,         &lt;br /&gt;
the sum of the numbers is D, and the sum of the numeric characters is E.        &lt;br /&gt;
Then sum all of these. A + B + C + D + E to get F        &lt;br /&gt;
Double this number, F,  and add half of the result to the fractional part of the next&lt;br /&gt;
North coordinate and add the other half to the fractional part of the next West coordinate.        &lt;br /&gt;
That will give you the real coordinates for the next stop.        &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the final stop you will find a small lock &amp;amp; lock with a log and SWAG.        &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
Start at    N 44  25.222    W 118 58.613&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
The second stop is    N 44  24.501    W 118 57.208&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
The final stop is    N 44  25.210    W 118 58.598&lt;/p&gt;

Great day for caching with DRT51 and visiting with other cachers who crossed our paths while working the loop. Having time to spare after completing that series, we picked up a few other caches in the area that we hadn't gotten to on previous visits. Unfortunately, we couldn't get to stage 2 based on our computations using two different interpretations of the instructions. Will contact CO for some clarification and give it another try the next time we are in the area if we get some help.</groundspeak:text>

the next day went and checked those to find nothing to lead us further.

today went back to our original numbers and tried to field locate those but gave it up after it put us in an unlikely area.  heck with it.

then went to the pizza feed and ended up with a clue from one of the local cachers which paid off for us. doubt we would ever have found this one without help.</groundspeak:text>

There are many beautiful views to the East of mountains along with numerous juniper trees and sage brush. On the east side of the road is grassy views and mountains and on the west side is some bare land. You can get to many different places along this road if you are up for a road trip. The&amp;nbsp;highway is very curvy, straightens out and then is curvy again where it ends at the destination point at a large open wide spot where you can park. Large rock piles there as well. Not many people at this location. Maybe a few muggles on a Sunday drive.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Cache is a small camo container hidden in a fairly obvious location.   The coordinates may be off as much as 20 feet but you will see there aren't many hiding places so  coordinates should not be a problem.  I averaged twice for 5 minutes and still could do no better than 20 feet off. I could blame the full moon I guess.  

This is an interesting community with history in  the early days of logging.  Not much logging now and the claim to fame now is once being the coldest spot in the US at 53 below zero.  This location is a recreation location and also a community gathering spot with some excellent oysters to feast on in May.

This is a family friendly location and a family friendly cache.  Has some small items, log sheet and pencil.  

During winter the area may have significant snow and cache may be difficult to find.  In the summer you may be hit by small round items falling from the sky.</groundspeak:long_description>

The container contains various valuable trade items and a log book.  Also, be sure to include the code word inside the lid on your passport.&lt;span style="line-height:1.6;"&gt;  You should know exactly the meaning of the name once you reach the correct location.  These little signs are found all over the forest and  have various names such as reference marker, bearing tree  and section markers. Basically this sign will tell you where you are in relation  to township, range and section.  The nail marks the spot.  I can recall in 1966 when I was a fire control aide for the Malheur National Forest, there used to be wooden signs shaped somewhat like the state of Tenneesee which contained the same information as the yellow signs.  These signs serve little purpose today as most GPS systems can give you the needed information.  In this area there seems to be a significant number of the signs which have fallen victim to target practice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The cemetery has a very nice sheltered kiosk where you can look up the names of those buried here and find their plot on the handy wall map.  It truly is one of the nicest setups I've seen and something I'd love to see at other cemeteries for those visiting that want to locate their distant relatives and old friends.

The cemetery itself is divided in to parts, old and new.  The oldest section is farthest north.  Most of the newest graves are on the south side.

This cache is a little different in that it is hidden in plain sight.  This is a strictly no-trade cache, log only!  Don't be surprised to see names of others signing in.  Use your geocaching handle to distinguish yourself.

Daylight hours only, please.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Not that many years ago, when logging was still big business in Grant County, I would drive this road to take my kids to piano every week. &amp;nbsp;On a fairly regular basis this spot had a white van sitting here, ready to record the weight of the log trucks as they came and went. &amp;nbsp;As time has passed, mills have closed, log trucks have sat idle, and weigh stations have become obsolete. &amp;nbsp;The scales are still here, but I haven&amp;#39;t seen a white van in a very long time. &amp;nbsp; I miss the sound of the saws at work, the steady stream of trucks along the highway, and the smell of sawdust. &amp;nbsp;I&amp;#39;m sad to see how the economy has been flushed away. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for now, I&amp;#39;ll just enjoy the view and remember the past. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   Ok as we was driving up to the cache we saw a man and two kids walking around, the little boy had a phone in his hand and was looking like he was looking for something. They was the same thing we was the cache. It was there first day of geocaching. And they live just down the street from our family in Prairie City. How cool is that. 
   We was over here in the John Day area to do some more caching, camping and seeing family in Prairie City. Took this drive in May when we was up here caching, and we are back to get the 2015 Grant County Cachers Geocoin. thank you for all the hard work.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6"&gt;You are hunting a camo&amp;#39;d peanut butter container. &amp;nbsp;This spot has plenty of parking space and room for a large vehicle to turn around, but if there&amp;#39;s heavy snow, it might take a bit of work. &amp;nbsp;It should be accessible year-round.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This year&amp;#39;s theme is &amp;quot;Caching On The Rails&amp;quot;. &amp;nbsp;Although there are no longer any active rail lines in the county, there is a rich railroad history in the area. We also want to showcase the beauty that is Grant County Oregon!&lt;/p&gt;
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Here you will find the&lt;strong&gt; Huddleston Trailhead &lt;/strong&gt;and a small gravel parking area big enough for 2 cars or so. More than that, and you might not be able to turn around. &amp;nbsp;The trail is most popular in the late summer when the river level is low and horses can cross easily. &amp;nbsp;During fishing season, its a perfect spot to bring a pole and spend an afternoon in solitude. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kickoff for the new 2015 Grant County Trackable Geocoin will be at 9AM, June 13th, at the Grant County Chamber of Commerce, 301 West Main Street, John Day.&lt;br /&gt;
Find code words in 15 of the 20 caches to claim the 2015 Geocoin (one per family). There will only be 150 coins minted!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are unable to attend the kickoff event, log sheets will be available outside the Chamber of Commerce office. &amp;nbsp;After the event, coins can be claimed at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grant County Chamber of Commerce, 301 West Main Street, John Day - Monday-Saturday 9AM-12PM and 1PM to 4PM.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kam Wah Chung Visitor&amp;#39;s Center, 125 NW Canton Street, John Day - Sunday 9AM-12PM and 1PM to 5PM. Geocoins must be picked up in person, we are unable to mail coins.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache is located at a reclaimed mill site. There is a pond for fishing that is stocked by the Oregon Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife. In addition to fish, the pond is also host to many turtles and bullfrogs. The pond is surrounded by graveled walking trails that connect to the Clyde Holliday State Park about a 1/4 of a mile away. Along the paths, you will also find benches and picnic tables to sit, relax and soak in the beautiful nearby mountains and the wildlife that lives here. Parking is located at N:44 24.992 and W:119 05.876. The container is an ammo box filled with the usual trading goodies. Remember, this is a public fishing area. During the season there will be many muggles. Please rehide well.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I pass this site every day on my way to and from work. &amp;nbsp;Curiousity finally got the better of me and I started asking some old-timers about it. &amp;nbsp;I&amp;#39;ve been told it was called the &amp;quot;C-Sash mine&amp;quot;, it was part of an old mill, and a few other odd answers. &amp;nbsp;Finally asked a rancher who was feeding across the street and he said it has been used for various things over the years, but he always knew it as &amp;quot;Cobalt Mine&amp;quot;. &amp;nbsp;Since Cobalt is one of my favorite colors, I decided to take his version and run with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cache is not on private property, not inside the fence line, and you will have to park about 25 feet before GZ if you&amp;#39;re heading north. &amp;nbsp;If you&amp;#39;re heading south, I suggest turning around, or be prepared to walk a bit. &amp;nbsp;This road gets a lot of foot traffic with dog walkers and joggers, plus plenty of vehicle traffic, so please be careful both for safety sake and stealth. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, be aware that you will have to cross a narrow creek. &amp;nbsp;I have long legs and did it in my tennis shoes, but if you&amp;#39;re short or worry about wet feet, you might want to haul your boots along. &amp;nbsp; The container is a camo&amp;#39;d finger paint jar with room for a few small trading items only. &amp;nbsp;Small TBs/coins will be fine there too. &amp;nbsp;The hiding spot is pretty obvious on approach so please be sure to cover it well when you put it back.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cache on!&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;We found our first Christmas tree in Grant County up this road many years ago. &amp;nbsp;I&amp;#39;ve since noticed horse fans using this as a starting point for a day&amp;#39;s ride and there may be vehicles parked when you come, but there&amp;#39;s plenty of room for you too. &amp;nbsp;Besides, the hunt won&amp;#39;t take long. &amp;nbsp;Snap a few pictures of the river while you search and noone will think twice about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kickoff for the new 2015 Grant County Trackable Geocoin will be at 9AM, June 13th, at the Grant County Chamber of Commerce, 301 West Main Street, John Day.&lt;br /&gt;
Find code words in 15 of the 20 caches to claim the 2015 Geocoin (one per family). There will only be 150 coins minted!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are unable to attend the kickoff event, log sheets will be available outside the Chamber of Commerce office. &amp;nbsp;After the event, coins can be claimed at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grant County Chamber of Commerce, 301 West Main Street, John Day - Monday-Saturday 9AM-12PM and 1PM to 4PM.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a popular camping and fishing spot although it is open to vehicles only from May-October. &amp;nbsp;You can walk in from the gate during the off-season so long as the main highway is not closed for snow. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can plan ahead, bring empty water jugs and fill them with water from the spring at the edge of the picnic area. &amp;nbsp;Our family does this every time we come. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">You are looking for a large ammo can hidden near the Mt Vernon city hall. Mt Vernon is a small town and geocachers may be watched as the search continues. This provides an opportunity to share with others about the sport of geocaching. The one staff inside the building is aware of where the cache is hidden if you find yourself having trouble.
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is placed to honor Sue Newstetter who resided across the street from this location until her recent passing.  Sue was a professional land surveyor and one of the first female surveyors in Oregon.  For  two decades she operated a business called Eastern Oregon Professional Services from which her skills made an impact on dozens of communities throughout Eastern Oregon by updating community halls, city infrastructures and county services.  Projects she was most proud of included updating the Lake Creek Youth Camp, promoting Grant County through the Healthy Forest Now videos and Forest For All book series, and the Healthy Smiles Dental Clinic.  She participated in Journey Through Times, Cinnabar Mountain Rendezvous, Mount Vernon Promoters, Grant County Library Foundation, John Day Community Garden, GREAT and many fund raisers and charity events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to all the above noted activities, Sue was also known  for the fun things she did on the side.  Sue was an excellent dutch oven cook and also was skilled at solar oven cooking.  She was a lover of tear drop trailer camping, fishing, gardening, reading, crafting and creative dress.  As time allowed she did a little geocaching.  Her smile and her sparkling personality was always present along with a wonderful sense of humor.  Sue was known for her love of the color lime green and her lime green stuffed dash hound was often present in pictures as she documented her travels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is hidden on public property in Mt Vernon, Oregon.  You are looking for a large ammo can with various items for exchange.  Originally placed in this cache is a travel bug (Traveling With Sue NSDMM1) which may be on the road as you make your search.  Naturally this TB is a lime green teardrop trailer and has a tracking tag provided by the NCEES  a professional survey organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.   Happy traveling Sue!!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is one of 20 all-new physical caches included in 2015 Grant County Cachers Geocoin Kickoff Event ( GC5QGMT) . This year's theme is "Caching On The Rails".  Although there are no longer any active rail lines in the county, there is a rich railroad history in the area. We also want to showcase the beauty that is Grant County Oregon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kickoff for the new 2015 Grant County Trackable Geocoin will be at 9AM, June 13th, at the Grant County Chamber of Commerce, 301 West Main Street, John Day.  Find code words in 15 of the 20 caches to claim the 2015 Geocoin (one per family). There will only be 150 coins minted!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are unable to attend the kickoff event, log sheets will be available outside the Chamber of Commerce office.  After the event, coins can be claimed at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grant County Chamber of Commerce, 301 West Main Street, John Day - Monday-Saturday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kam Wah Chung Visitor's Center, 125 NW Canton Street, John Day - Sunday 9AM-12PM and 1PM to 5PM.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;          Geocoins must be picked up in person, we are unable to mail coins. 9AM-12PM and 1PM to 4PM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Riverside Schoolhouse&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The School House dates back to around 1900 (between 1898 and 1905), no one knows for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The School was originally the "Winegar School" and was first located about a mile west of where it stands now. Ten years or so later, the building was moved to its present location on the headwaters of the John Day River, where it was renamed the "Riverside School" and was used to educate the children of the area until the early 1960's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The School House was originally one room, but was later split into two rooms to accommodate the needs of the children. One, and sometimes two teachers taught as many as twenty five students from the first grade through high school.Most of the students walked or rode horses to school. The barn where the horses were kept is still standing near the School House today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Riverside School House is the only one room school house still standing in the area and the original school bell, which was installed in 1913, is still hanging.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Cache is a painted container containing some stike anytime matches, hand warmers, log and pencil.  This cache is for adult outdoors folks and is just right for elk hunters.  

This cache is placed in support of the Elmore family and the memories they share in this particular area.  You will find a very nice marker within a few feet of the cache.  Please recall your outdoors adventures and the many memories you have about those  times with family while enjoying your  favorite activity (or season) and you will appreciate this area.  Please respect the area and help in keeping it clean and a special place.

I do not know  the family but my time in the area hunting elk has left me with fond memories even without being succesful with the hunt-so far.</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well color me crazy!  THAT was an adventure to say the least.   
The log that was previously blocking the road is now out of the way.  That does not mean this road is in any way an easy drive.  About mid-way up I started to wonder if maybe I should've given up at the first big mud puddle.  By the time I got to where the road crosses the stream,  I knew I had completely lost my marbles, but I was committed by this time and there was no way I was going back now!   In my mind I was hearing Mel Gibson as William Wallace in Braveheart:  "Freedom!"

So for those who follow:  if the first giant mud puddle doesn't make you squeamish, carry on.  It only gets worse.  Also, when you get to the fork in the road (its an obvious one), take the high road.  The low road has an assortment of downed trees and unless you've brought along a chainsaw, your rig isn't going to make it.  Ask me how I know.  

If you're on an ATV, you can ignore this next part.  If you're in a street legal vehicle of any kind, you will have to park when you get within a tenth of a mile, or take the long winding road around the mountain one more time.  Seriously, the walk is easy, even with some snow on the ground.  All in all, once we got to GZ, it was only a few minutes to make the find.  We spent more time snapping photos than hunting the cache.  

Well worth the trip!  (unless I wake up to find a flat tire tomorrow)</groundspeak:text>

Unfortunately there was a large fallen tree in the road and we didn't have a chain saw along.  lol  I'm sure we could've walked the rest of the way if we had planned for the time, but since we had to be back with the vehicle in time for my son to go to work, we turned around and will have to try again.  Bummer.

I'm including a picture of the sign by the bridge at the bottom just to be sure we were on the right road.  If not, I'd appreciate a hint on the correct road.</groundspeak:text>

Find #9442.  TNLN.  Signed all the logs with ORCA (my brother resides in ORegon, I in CAlifornia).  581+ miles and 27 days, 15 hours, 7 minutes from publication notification email to FTF.  [8D][8D] Co-FTF with Bubblegummers [8D][8D].  Distance measured from the location where I decided to go after the FTF attempt (my home).  Duration calculated from notification email date/time to FTF date/time.  Didn’t need an FTF Blackout Bingo find today (an FTF on every calendar day of the year), but am trying to keep a 6 FTF / week find pace to get to 300 FTFs for the year.  Next 10 FTF Blackout Bingo days are September 16, 28, October 5, 6, 11, 14, 22, 23, 24, &amp; 25 [8D]. 

Out with the male part of the Bubblegummers (my brother) on day 15 of my 17 day California, Oregon, and all over Idaho vacation caching trip with goals to:

COMPLETE:
-- IDAHO'S DeLORME CHALLENGE http://coord.info/GCQVXZ - DONE [:D][:D][:D]
-- Cache Across Idaho (all counties) http://coord.info/GC1HXKC - DONE [:D][:D][:D]
AND FIND:
-- Cache Across America - Idaho http://coord.info/GC4QRVD - DONE [:D][:D][:D]
-- An FTF in at least 5 new counties to bring my total counties with an FTF to 100 - DONE [:D][:D][:D]

Had my notifications for identifying the FTF candidates along the trip route for the prior month.  This is one that published 35.6 miles northeast of Burns, OR.  We were both surprised this hadn’t been attempted in the weeks before now.  Traveled 182+ miles from Boise and approached GZ.  Walked down hill a short distance and quickly spotted it.  Opened it up to see a nice clean log [8D].  

Traveled 10+ hours, 410.9 miles (0.9 on foot) from Boise, ID to Redmond, OR with a cost today of $19.04 per find.  Totals thru today on the trip starting 8/31 in Concord, CA: 5,271.1 miles (23.1 on foot), 233 finds with an average cost of $9.70 per find.  This was #1 of 5 found today.  Good coordinates and hint.  This was one of our last caches of the Idaho portion of the trip as we were ready to be back in Redmond (see photo).  For a new FTF county and real nice weather, this one’s going on my “Favorites List” [^][^][^].  Cache is in good shape.  Replaced as found.  Logged the FTF at 11:38 AM from the top of the mountain where I had a barely serviceable 1X signal for my Samsung Galaxy Note3.  I try to spare other FTF hounds from wasting a trip and gas on a failed FTF attempt not to mention the incredible disappointment [:(!]  It probably (almost certainly) didn’t matter this time as it had been out for a few weeks.  Elevation per my GPSr is 3365 feet.  Weather about 45 degrees this late morning.  Sunny, shady, slight breeze, nice, quiet.  Another GREAT “DAY” for an FTF [8D].  TFTH.</groundspeak:text>

Decided to try for a few FTF's on our way home which made the trip not quite direct but worth the detours. This was our fourth of four for the day.

Your journey will take you down a well used path before you take off for a short climb to the cache site.  You will be at an elevation of 5000 feet.  The terrain is not difficult but is rated at 2.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The finder will locate a camo colored peanut butter type container marked "Geocache".  Contents include the normal variety of mainly useless stuff except when viewed by the eyes of a child.  The view of the area and the signing of the log is your reward.

The actual cache will take you closely by a marker placed by the forest service as a means of tracking changes in landscape over the years.  It would be interesting to view the various pictures of the area taken from this location.</groundspeak:long_description>

Plenty of daylight after work so I went out to one of the closer lookouts without a cache at it.  About an hour South from John Day and a nice drive no matter which direction you approach it from.

You will be able to take your town ride most if not all the way into this tower site with a short walk to the cache location.

The tower itself is closed to access so don't plan on climbing it at this time.

The cache is a camouflaged one liter water bottle with a few goodies in it. Please place the logbook on the top so it is easy to remove.</groundspeak:long_description>

     ways to get to the Magone Slide trail. The first is from John
     Day:(paved the whole way) Follow HWY 26 east towards Prairie
     City until you see county road 18(on the left). Follow county
     road 18 for 12 miles (following Magone Lake signs)then turn
     left on Forest Service road 3620 (following Magone Lake
     signs)about 3 miles to the trailhead (road 3620 will switch to
     3618,go right at the Y, stay on pavement.) The other way is:
     From Mt Vernon go north on HWY 395 then take a right onto
     County Rd. 32 and follow the magone lake signs(about 7 miles)
     Magone lake has camping and fishing spots available and the
     slide trail will give you an idea how this lake came to be.
     Enjoy the wonderful scenery. Bill &amp;amp; Lori

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;If you are hiking the lake trail, park in the day-use area.  If you've already found the other 2 caches on the lake, park at the overnight sign nearest to the lake and take the short dirt trail to the asphalt covered portion of the lake trail.  After you cross the bridge, you will see the informational sign on beaver activity, and notice a log bench nearby.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Container is a green painted lock n' lock with log and assorted goodies.  Please return it to its hiding place.   Cache will not be available during the winter.&lt;/p&gt;

With the elevation of this cache there will be times of the year that you cannot get to it because of the snow and it may be really muddy when it rains.&lt;/div&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;div style="margin:0px;padding:0px;"&gt;Completing this caching challenge will take time, hard work and many miles of traveling. MsSkarlet and I love finding geocaches at fire lookout towers and do a lot of mountain range caching. We have driven to many of the caches that would qualify for this challenge in our Jeep Rubicon as some areas are better accessed by high clearance 4-wheel drive vehicles. If you are working on the &lt;a href="http://coord.info/GC15CVW" target="_blank"&gt;Oregon Fire Tower Challenge&lt;/a&gt; you probably have claimed caches that also meet requirements for this challenge. To qualify for the Oregon Elevation Challenge you will need 56 caches in all. You must have:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="margin:15px 0px 0px 0px;padding:0px;"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6 caches in the elevation range from 0 to 50 feet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6 caches in the elevation range from 50 to 999 feet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6 caches in the elevation range from 1000 to 1999 feet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6 caches in the elevation range from 2000 to 2999 feet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6 caches in the elevation range from 3000 to 3999 feet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6 caches in the elevation range from 4000 to 4999 feet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6 caches in the elevation range from 5000 to 5999 feet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6 caches in the elevation range from 6000 to 6999 feet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 caches in the elevation range from 7000 to 7999 feet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 caches in the elevation range from 8000 to 8999 feet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 caches in the elevation range from 9000 feet and over&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="margin:15px 0px 0px 0px;padding:0px;"&gt;To check your elevation you can use your GPSr, Google Earth, or a GSAK macro. AND ALL THE CACHES MUST BE IN OREGON. Found and placed caches count. You must bookmark them so I can check them. Okay I hate to do this but you do need to qualify before you go get it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="margin:15px 0px 0px 0px;padding:0px;"&gt;Please remember to go prepared as many of these caches are out in the wilderness and you might be the only one around for miles!!!!! We drove within 60 feet of the cache. You will need a high clearance rig to get to this cache and 4-wheel drive would be nice too. The last .2 mile gets really steep so some may what to hike the last .2 miles.&lt;/div&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">DONE!!   Tincuphunter and i headed over to Eastern Oregon to get the final Caches necessary to complete this Challenge and had a great time doing it!

I guided tincuphunter up probably the most difficult access road at the start but his driving skills were more than a match for what was encountered.   We reached the recommended parking area and continued (Had to navigate around a fallen tree.) up the STEEP slope to finally park within 30 feet of the Cache.    The mountain top was alive with butterflies and there were plenty of wildflowers.

Quickly searched for and Found the Cache, Signed the Log and returned it to its hiding place.   Pleased to see that the last Find was a year and a day back in the past which means that it qualifies for the "Caches Not Found for a Year Challenge"!

Wandered around the top of the mountain enjoying the view and then quickly slid down to a lower elevation.   Followed the nuvi's instructions for a much easier route out to the Paved road!!!    Sometimes the nuvi IS CORRECT!

BB&amp;CB mentioned that they got there in a "car".    How?    Under a helicopter??    This is a 4-wheel drive high clearance vehicle access!!

TFTC!!    This Cache deserves several Favorites but can only get 1  --  Bummer!

cache On and Enjoy Oregon's Great Outdoors,

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The first Frazier Lookout consisted of a small lookout house built in 1934 atop a rock outcrop at 6240&amp;#39;.&amp;nbsp; In 1936, the 100&amp;#39; wooden lookout tower was built 1/2 mile to the northwest.&amp;nbsp; Both appear to have co-existed for awhile in the late 1930s.&amp;nbsp; In fact, originally the tower location was referred to as North Frazier Point Lookout!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll need to park and walk to this one, about 2/10 mile with about 150&amp;#39; elevation gain.&amp;nbsp; Best approach is from the northwest.&amp;nbsp; At the listed parking coordinates, hop the range fence and head up.&amp;nbsp; If you take the direct route rock scrambling will be involved, otherwise veer around the northeast side of the rock ledges for an easier grade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re looking for a camoed plastic container.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This is my very first cache placement. My crew and I decided to place this cache here on our very last day working in this section of the forest. The view from the cache location will be one of the best you will find. The theme for this cache is things from around the world. So bring older objects from around the globe</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Cache is a 30 cal ammo can. Items placed inside consist of one dollar for the FTF. Several foreign coins, two 45-70 shell casings from an Indian war era fort, and other various trinkets. The cache is on a very steep rocky spine that soars above the ridge top. Excellent view but difficult climbing. There is an old road that ends about 100 feet from the site. I would recommend driving either a pickup or an SUV with decent clearance. I would recommend this site to those that are not of the feint of heart. Good luck finding the cache</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Short work day so I went out to this sight and placed a cache to see who it attracts.

Not to hard to locate this one during the summer and early fall months but winter and spring could pose problems for you, even with snow machines to get to the location.

The best way in is to go to Prairie City, hang a South onto 62 and follow it for right at 20 miles, hang a East on the 1665 road just before the 20 mile marker and the sno-park and follow it to the top, keep going North around Summit Rock and hang another North on road 548.

This will lead you right to the site and give you some great views of Summit Prairie, Logan Valley, Strawberry Mountain, Monument Rock, Ironside Mountains and many other spots between there and here.

The cache is a small container, a Gatorade mix canister, it is well hidden and well camouflaged.</groundspeak:long_description>

Yeah, it is only like 2 miles by GPS when you leave the road, but not so by back road. Realized as I approached the top I had not allowed for the curves and decreased speed when planning how much time this would take before my night shift.  Then had trouble finding the cache as I worried about getting to work on time, but after driving all that way, did not want end up skunked! Found the cache and made a speed runoff the mountain...By the way, no one mentioned a very heavy dysfunctional gate!!  MAde it to work officially 15 minutes late, but didn't actually miss anything.

In reality, the drive up to this former lookout site took about 1/2 hour, but we took our time and babied our tires over the rocks and ruts; this vehicle doesn't have 10-ply tires.  We're glad the coords were accurate, because the cache was well-hidden.  Thanks for another fine adventure, Logscaler and Red.  Now, on to the top of Lookout Mountain...</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is not your typical Oregon rest area.  The bathrooms are only the beginning.  There's a pioneer schoolhouse to peek in, a nice play area for the kids, and some benches and picnic tables for your recreation.  There's even a large pet area.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Before hunting the cache, we suggest reading the signs posted on the outside of the facilities.  Then wander over to peek in the school, and maybe even out back to the livery.  From there, you can head to the cache - across the pet area and into the corner.  Its a pretty routine hiding spot - no creativity involved.  We just wanted to point out the best rest area we've ever come across.  After a long day of caching along 395, you'll be glad to know this is here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache container is a camo'd tea tin - the copper lid is still visible.  Room for small trackables and tradeables, but nothing too big. I haven't been up here when there's snow on the ground, but since the ground is level and cache is inside the fence, I expect that it will be accessible as long as you don't mind trudging through the snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It probably doesn't need to be said, but just in case:  treat the grounds lightly so that it may be enjoyed for years to come, and replace the cache as you found it.  Muggles come in more than one size and shape around here.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Smokey the Bear is well-known to many. A lesser-known Smokey is a Chocolate Lab who lives nearby. This is one of his favorite places to cool off in the summer, chase a duck or two later in the year or just run on the ridges. 

The cache contains:

-Folding scissors
-Flashlight
-Ice cube from Ochoco Viewpoint Cache
-Match container
-Dry erase marker
-Smokey "stuff"
-Signal mirror
-Misc.

This "site" will not show up on older maps. There is easy access from Hwy 395 and Grant County Road 73. Park near the dam and strike out from there.

The cache is located on top of a rim. If you look ahead and pick your routes, THERE SHOULD BE NO NEED FOR ROCK CLIMBING. If you have made it this far, walk a little further north along the rim for even more spectacular views of the Silvies Valley.

Now, the one thing to note, there is no cache container.  There are 2 ziploc-type gallon bags with goodies inside, and all of them seem ok, but once winter hits, I' think they'd do a lot better in a real container.</groundspeak:text>

44:34.810 N 118:54.944 W
Elev. 6200 feet +/-

This should be an easy find for most everyone.

The last mile of road is kinda rough so I would suggest a higher clearance ride if you plan on driving in real close. 

The following is from Rex's Forest Fire Lookout Tower Sites.
(http://www.firelookout.com/or/lakebutte.html)

Lake Butte Fire Lookout Tower

R.I.P. 1938-1963

Established with a 33' pole L-4 tower in 1938, a 30' treated timber R-6 flat tower was constructed in 1963. In the 1970's, it was moved to Antelope Mtn. L.O..

I went up the 18 road past Magone Lake and up the hill on the 279 road. You can come in from several different ways and leave the area a different way.

The cache container is an old ammo can fairly well hidden but the numbers should be tight.</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">After swimming at Magone, we decided to take a side trip and look for this cache.  I was a bit worried about the rig, but shouldn't have been.  Didn't put it in 4WD till the last 1/2 mile or so when the climb got a bit much.  Coming over the crest and bursting out into the open was an amazing moment.  There is no describing the view.  You just have to see it for yourself.
We parked "right there" and walked the little bit to the top where the 12 yo made the find.  I photographed the "anchor" because I was curious coming up what that might look like and thought perhaps someone in the future might have the same question.  
After we left, we got back to the Magone turn-off when said 12 yo suddenly realized she had left her electronic gadgets on the hood of the car and they must've fallen off as we headed down.  Yikes.  Visions of smashed items came to mind, but we had to face that road again and look.  Sure enough, not more than 100 feet from the top, there they were in the middle of the road.  HOW they managed to avoid being smashed to bits is beyond me, but they were both in good working order, just a bit dusty.  Amazing!

Anyway - thank you for the hide.  Would never have known this spot existed otherwise.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Red and I went out of John Day early to place this cache before it got to hot.

I will help you out a bit. 

Off of Highway 26 just west of Mile Marker 144, turn South onto USFS rd 2100 and head up Fields creek for about 8.5 miles, turn North onto rd 2100 -115 and follow this gravel road about 1.6 miles to the trail head. There is plenty of room to camp here as well as drop off 4-wheelers or horses. There is even a station for the horses to tie up and be fed at. There is plenty of camping lower down as well.

The trailhead is to the North of the parking spot. This is a shared trail so be aware you might meet horses or 4-wheelers at any turn.

We did not see any but I was told there are Bighorn Sheep up there somewhere.  We did find fresh Elk and Deer tracks as well as old Bear scat so take your optics when you go out.

While on top, we sat and watched thousands of Ladybugs flying around. Lots of flies and Butterfly's as well.

As a word of warning, we also picked off about 20 some odd ticks heading up and back down.

This will take you roughly 2 plus hours up. The trail is 2.3 miles from the trailhead to the top with a gain of 1840 feet.

Take lots of water, some food and overnight gear just in case you want to overnight close by the top.

The cache is an ammo box and is very well hidden.</groundspeak:long_description>

bear.........Took the hiking trail to the right of the ATV trail.
The hiking trail takes you to the valley between the mountains
then you have to bushwhack up until the first crest where you will find an old
trail that leads up to the cache. The trail is in humbug shape
but doable. Recommend that you follow the ATV trail instead.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Wow, 3rd to find on a cache over 2 years old.  I've had my eye on this one all summer.  One truck with horse trailer at the trailhead.  I can see where an ATV would have worked nicely to get up there!  Wide trail.  Steady climb all the way, only about 150' of 'flat' trail along the whole 2.3ish miles.  As I crested the first ridge I met a couple deer hunters dragging their morning kill down the trail.  When I got to the trail intersection 2/3rds of the way up I met the horse riders coming down.  Breezy up top but not cold for sure.  I explored what remains of the lookout then headed for the cache.  Coords were spot on.  On the way down I could see smoke from a couple forest fires started by last night's lightning getting cranked up south of Aldrich Mtn.  By the time I got back to the trailhead my legs were about to give out, but the fires were looking to really catch their second wind.  TFTH.</groundspeak:text>

So back up we went today and were surprised to see that it was SNOWING hard while were up there.  Visibility was extremely low....was kind of bummed about that.  We will have to go back up again just to check out the view.  I imagine that it is quite something from up there.  Just reminants of what use to be a lookout.  Cool spot.  We took matches and the Travel Bug and left a Penquin figure...it was fitting for such a cold day.  Thanks for hiding such great caches...we LOVE finding them :)</groundspeak:text>

The trail was dusty, but no sign of the blasted noisemakers out today, nice and quiet.  More critter trails than tire treads. Hot afternoon, but the breeze was refreshing once you get out on top.

Found the cache tucked in nicely and after wrestling off the lid, I took 2 TBs, one remains. Left something too.

The ridgetop scramble over to Moore Mountain looks very inviting, wish I'd had time to give that a try. 

Thanks for the fun!

ps I'm changing all the "members only caches" that I've logged to notes or deleting them. I'll change it back to a smiley when you make this cache available to everyone.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This cache is on land owned by ODFW.  There is a small pond with an abundance of wildlife present. The terrain is basically level with an occasional need to walk thru tall grass and over branches in the path.  You will pass along the banks of the John Day River, however a fence and native growth provides a level of safety.

This location provides an excellent opportunity to view birds, beaver, deer, ducks and undisturbed nature.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The cache is a painted plastic jar  with various items of interest.  

While in this area you may want to pick up "Boo Moon" and "John Day River Bridge" which are close by.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This site was established in the 1930's with a firefinder and a cabin.  The living quarters are long gone.  There is an existing platform atop the rocks with a firefinder stand, but I'm not sure it dates back that far.  Fire crews still use this vantage point on their patrols.

You can drive all the way to the site.  You can make it there without 4WD if the roads are dry.  You might want something with clearance though.  Winter access requires alternate transportation.

You're looking for a small camoed plastic container.</groundspeak:long_description>

Now i see several people followed and logged. Either I'm blind, or everyone is finding my replacement.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Hi everyone. :) My daughter found it! She finds everything. Lol We were out hunting morel mushrooms and she stumbled across it. Upon seeing it I told them this was a very cool and big deal. Now that we are home, I downloaded the app and am showing them all about it. We are learning together and it looks more fun and bigger than I even imagined. Looking forward to becoming a regular geocashing family adventure for us. Thank you all for the wonderful game.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Here is another entry in my series of hides near fire lookouts.  This is Big Rock Lookout, 6020', in the Malheur National Forest.
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Established in the mid-1930s, the site was likely little more than a secondary, emergency lookout post, a supplement to the nearby Lake Butte Lookout.  &lt;a href="http://iamwho.com/cdv2/eastOr/malheur/malh030/site.htm"&gt;Panoramic photos&lt;/a&gt; were taken here on September 18, 1935.  In it, you can clearly see the field telephone, a fence enclosure, and the photo operator's vehicle.  The site was likely abandoned in the 1940s.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You'll need to park and walk to this one, just over 1/2 mile from the listed parking coordinates to the top, with an elevation gain of just over 350'.  As you attempt to follow the closed former road to the top (FS Road 364), look up 15 - 20' in the larger trees and you might see the brown ceramic insulators which held up the phone line which served the site.  I was able to locate 3 of them along the route.  I suspect many others have disappeared over time due to logging, target shooting and 'collectors'.  Please leave those you see in place so that future generations can discover them.  Other than relics of the forest phone system, I didn't find much else for evidence at the top.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You're looking for a clear, plastic Gladware container.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is my first time hiding or finding a cache with a terrain or difficulty rating higher than a 2, so I apologize in advance if the rating is off a bit.  I reserve the right to make changes should the need arise.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;We were out exploring in the Malheur forest today, testing out our temporary geo-rig, and surveying the damage in this area.  Between the bug-kill and the Bald Sisters fire, its a pretty tough thing to see if you love the woods as much as we do.  As we were placing the cache, the wind was howling through the trees.  It was kind of eerie and kind of cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get to the cache, take the 13 road to the top and turn left on FS Rd 600.  Currently, there is a staging area for the Bald Sisters fire directly across at the rock pit, so its possible there will be fire personnel nearby.  This road is still open to the public and well away from the fire lines, so you should be able to travel safely as long as you factor in that the 600 road is rough, rocky, worn, and dusty (or muddy depending on when you visit).  About a mile or so in, you will see evidence of woodcutting near the road.  We drove past this spot a bit and turned around when there was a wide enough spot to do so.   Park as far off to the side as you possibly can since this road is not wide enough for 2 vehicles in most places.   That said, in our 4-plus hours up here, we only came across one hunter, so its likely you will be able to find the cache and get back on your way without having to share the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take note:  there is no trail.  You will have to bushwack your way from the road to the cache location, up a short hill, about 50 yards off-road.  You will come to a clearing and the cache is at the edge of the clearing near the rocks.  Depending on the time of year, there may be ticks or mosquitoes although in the cool dry Autumn air, we had neither.  There is quite a bit of debris on the forest floor, so be aware of hazards as you hunt. This area is not easily accessed when there is snow on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Left a TB - come get it!  &lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This is the 14th in my series of hides near fire lookout towers.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Black Butte Lookout, 6235', in the Malheur National Forest, was built in 1936.  It started as an L-4 cab atop a 15' wooden pole tower.  Over the years the original legs were replaced with a treated timber superstructure and the original window shutter system phased out with a more permanent solution.  It continues to be used during periods of extreme fire danger and after lightning storms.

From Highway 395 at Beech Creek Summit, turn west on County Road 88 (FS 3950).  Within 1 mile turn south on Forest Road 3955.  Follow uphill to Road 3956.  Follow this to the 034 spur to the top.  It's about 7 miles one way from the Highway.  NOTE: the last 2 miles are rough/rocky/muddy/dusty/steep and washed out in places.  Leave the low-clearance rig at home or walk from Turn #4.

You're seeking a camo-painted lock-n-lock container with logbook, writing instruments, and a few trades.

But it matches the condition of the LO. Sorry to see it that way - needs TLC: paint, carpentry, etc.  In this weather I expected to see company out there but I suppose they think the fire season's over. I don't.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Forested area, with various elevation terrain.  Driveable with 4-wheel drive vehicle, ATV, or snowmobile.  Significant snow country in winter.  Elevation:  6,297.

This cache is reached from 7.1 miles of one-lane dirt road.  The road is in poor condition in some areas, but is easily traversed with 4-wheel drive trucks, jeeps, etc. if there is no snow.  So go prepared for a rough country cache find.

From John Day or Prairie City travel east on Highway 26 to the Dixie Summit.  Turn left (north) on FS 2610 and bear right.  Then stay left.  It is the road to the Dixie mountain lookout.  When passing the ski rope tow facility a short distance up this road indicates you are on the correct road.  You will cross two cattleguards while on this road.

From the pavement (HWY 26) travel north on FS 2610  4.1 miles.  Turn left on to road FS 759 and immediately cross a cattleguard.  Continue on FS 759 for 3.0 miles to the cache.  You will cross another cattle guard on the road.  This road is narrow and proceeds up and down various terrains.

The cache is on level ground in a saddle which is a significant crossing for point for deer and elk.

Note:  continuing west past the cache site along FS 759 will provide access to Prairie City from the north via other FS roads.

The cache container is plastic with a camo exterior.  Initial contents include a Geocoin, Travel Bug, $, AA and AAA batteries, some swag items, as well as the cache log.

Good luck and good cache hunting.</groundspeak:long_description>

As usual, using geocaches as part of my trip planning brought me to all kinds of neat places [^].   It was a great time  	[:D] !!  This cache was #2 of the 23 I found on this trip.  The road there was kind of cool although a little primitive.  Cache condition is A-OK.   Nice cache, nice hide!  TFTF!!  [8D]

That was one rough gnarly road to travel tonight as I was heading back home.

I hit the top of Dixie pass at 1900 hours and hoped I had enough time to get to the cache and back out before dark.

Nope.

I did have to dodge a few rocks, kick a few out of the way and wiggle my way around some holes.

Did I mention I was in my work ride? Not the Dodge pickup?

A Toyota Corolla.

Yup.

All the way across from Dixie to PC via this very scenic route.

I was glad I did not have to go back out the way I came in as ITRI was logging over on the Dixie side and they have destroyed to road far worse then it was.  I hope they have to fix it.  Some of the dust hole blow outs where deep enough to feel like I was driving through deep water or snow.

Anyway, I did have a hunter give me the old double take look as he was sitting on his 4 wheeler and I want past him.

The guys in the hunting camp at the end of the good road where most likely waiting for me to come walking back in looking for a tow or a ride to town.

The worst part of the whole road was from Wickiup Springs down to the rock road.

No problem finding the cache as the numbers where spot on today.

I did snag out the buck and traveler and i think I dropped in a Silver Lake Arrowhead.

Added to the favorites list.

T4TH.

&lt;p&gt;The following is from the book &amp;quot;The Malheur National Forest &amp;ndash; An Ethnographic History: by Jerry Mosgrove&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The year of 1939 set an all-time record for fires on the Malheur Forest, as well as in Eastern Oregon.&amp;nbsp; On August 24 a lightning storm set some forty fires on the Forest.&amp;nbsp; All but three were handled when small.&amp;nbsp; The Big Cow Creek Fire blew up on August 26 and developed to 30,000 acres; 20,000 acres were on the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest.&amp;nbsp; The weather conditions and winds were such that this fire crowned night and day for a five-day period.&amp;nbsp; There were approximately 800 men employed on the Malheur section of this fire and about 1200 on the Wallowa-Whitman side.&amp;nbsp; During the same period of the Big Cow Creek Fire, the Reynolds Creek and Roberts Creek Fires of 150 acres and 1250 acres, respectively, occurred requiring 400 men to control them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The total damage to merchantable timber sustained by the Big Cow Creek Fire was $186,000 ($3.1 million in 2015 dollars).&amp;nbsp; The cost of suppression was $109,000 ($1.8 million in 2015 dollars).&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

I noticed this sign last fall when we hunted the Prairie Hill cache further up the road, and thought about putting one here, but as happens, got busy and forgot all about it.   I like your choice of hiding spot.  I had to make the grab because both of the kids I hauled along were too short.  They'll grow, right?

Took a penny, left a TB and Big C made some toy exchange of some sort.  I wasn't paying close attention - I was signing the log!

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I found this location while out scouting for deer.  Must be some old history with this one.  This cache is located on Malheur Forest land.    There is a nearby moving water hazard which can be navigated via stepping stones-when the water is low!!  Area may be difficult to get to during heavy snow.  A very scenic area and I challenge folks to just think about long ago and what this feature may have been for.  You are looking for a small plastic container  which is attached for safety.  Basically contains a log book, pencil and some very small items of little value.  The value of the cache to me is the beauty.</groundspeak:long_description>

I counted them and this is our 23rd LOT cache hide in Oregon.

I need to check total elevations and see just what it is.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Needing something to do after work today, I took a drive to check the snow level on Flagtail Mountain.

I did find plenty of snow and even too much in the road which caused a slight half hour delay before I could move along to the top.

According to Rex's page for this lookout:

A crow's nest tree platform (still there) was used as the first lookout in the 1920's. A 20' L-4 tower was built in 1933, along with a 30' L-5 tower 1 mile to the east. Then in 1966, the present 53' treated timber R-6 flat was constructed. It is staffed every summer.

Malheur National Forest

23 miles southwest of John Day Grant County, Oregon

Elevation 6584'

I did not see any tree platform as the last fire in the area seems to have been reason enough to scalp the area leaving a few smaller trees around but for the most part it was clearcut.

The cache container is a camouflaged plastic jar about half a gallon sized and is semi well hidden but as there are few people in the area, I did not make a big effort in disguising it.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">I had to get away from the hustle and bustle of downtown John Day
after work so I went out to this mountain top and placed a cache.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is right at 27 miles Northeast by East from downtown JD and
most of the way is on paved highway 26. At the top of Dixie Summit
pass, hang a North onto the dirt road - # 2610 hard right and the
first dirt road to the left. When you are going past the rope tow
at the ski area, your heading in the right direction on the right
road.
&lt;p&gt;At this juncture, I should tell you a little bit about this
road. It sucks. I would recommend a high clearance rig with good
traction tires. The first four (4) miles on the dirt road will be
very rough but if your careful, you might make it all the way to
the parking spot in your town ride. I would take Red&amp;rsquo;s ride,
but not if she was along to see where I was at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last 1.20 miles. This section of the road might make you
pinch and spit foam rubber if your nervous about narrow, steep,
rough, washed-out, sloughing roads. You will be required to either
hike up from the parking spot at N 44:34.217 X W 118:37.530 or have
a 4x4 setup of one kind or another with high clearance,
Volvo&amp;rsquo;s need not apply, and good traction tires to drive to
the top. Not a good place to be skittish, hammer it and hang on.
After all, those trees below the road should stop you and if not,
that other road way down there might. Or shanks mare, your
option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now once you get to the top, I parked next to the garage and
hiked around on the ridge top to where I placed the cache. There is
a benchmark awaiting you here also, if your into that. And if you
wander around there very much, see if you can spot
&amp;ldquo;Dixie&amp;rdquo;. It looks like someone was very bored at one
time or the next. There where a few critter tracks and beds and
&amp;ldquo;other&amp;rdquo; sign of mammals as well as a couple of Kestrels
hunting around the top of the knob. Heck, I even found the old
telegraph wire while wandering around. As well as a lot of old cans
and carbon pile batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One the way back out, there where &amp;ldquo;Large and Growly&amp;rdquo;
tracks in my pickup tracks. Looked like mamma and two cubs. As well
as a couple Snowshoes crossing in the headlights and one very fast
Mulie Doe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would recommend calling the Prairie City Ranger District about
the road if you try this in the spring. Not sure when it is opened
from the snowfall&amp;rsquo;s this place will get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a picnic and optics and plan on staying for a while. You
just might spot something in one of the large meadows on the
hillsides. Oh, one last thing, your looking for an ammo can. Okay
hide, not hard but sheltered for the snowfalls. Please replace it
back with the stone over it.&lt;/p&gt;

We made the "short" side trip to see this lookout tower and boy are we glad we did...stunning views and an awesome drive up a steep, narrow road. Fortunately the caretaker, Jerry, was  home and he welcomed us in to sign the logbook but not before his dog, Shep, greeted us in the parking area. We visited a bit while admiring the view.  Then we bid Jerry and Shep a farewell and set off in search of the cache. On our way, we found the triangulation station...double score!

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This feature is on the list of National Scenic Trails and is located well away from the normal hustle and bustle of downtown John Day, Prairie City or Long Creek.  

Now, how to get into here.  First, wait until there is no snow on the roads.  I went in from the John Day - Prairie City side.  In downtown John Day where Hwy 26 and 395 split at the only stop light in town, head East on Hwy. 26 towards Prairie City about 9.5 miles.  Turn North - Left - onto Bear Creek  Road, travel along the paved road about 9.7 miles to the  Four Corners intersection where Bear Creek road and Forest road 36 cross.Turn East - Right - onto the Forest Road - 36 - and head down Coxie Creek and Camp Creek about 8.7 miles until you come to Cougar Creek and a bridge. Along side of the road, there should be a sign pointing East to the trail head and the parking spot. Turn East, cross the bridge and follow the road about 0.3 miles to the parking spot at the trail head. 

Now, follow the trail out just about 0.30 miles to “Arch Rock”, making sure you read all the signs along the way.  After you have viewed the Arch, you can start looking for the cache.  Remember those first formations you walked through and the little stream bed you crossed?  I would suggest walking back to them and starting your search from there.Your looking for a round can, painted drab green, about one half gallon size. Something like 6-7 inches deep and about the same across.  A metal band holds the top on with a wing nut fastener and don’t loose the nut, please. 

The cache is not buried under any rocks or chunks or limbs but it is out of sight.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;My daughter and I were hunting the Black Butte LOT cache and turned at this spot by mistake.  We immediately noticed the pile of rocks, and then the memorial to Lloyd Thomas behind it.  We have no idea who LT was, but from the looks of things, he was well loved.  We intend to do a little research to find out more, but in the meantime, we placed the cache nearby.  Perhaps one of you knew him and could shed some light on this?&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The Cedar Grove Botanical Area contains the only isolated stand of Alaska yellow cedar east of the Cascades in the United States. This grove, is located on the northeast slope of Aldrich Mountain at the head of Buck Cabin Creek.  Cache is located inside the trail area.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a camo'd plastic spice jar.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;After working on the South Fork Complex fire crew this past summer, my better half insisted I needed to see this place.  So we headed up the trail, cache in hand (just in case!).  The trail itself is a 2-mile hike, but you will not need to make the complete hike to find the cache.  From the parking spot, cross the road to the trailhead and continue on the trail till you reach the fenceline.  You will need to open and reclose the gate.  The trail is clearly marked as being open to human foot traffic year-round, but take the year-round designation lightly as there will be heavy snowfall in the area from late November through early April most years.  Know your limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once inside the fence, continue along the trail until you come to a noble fir that has fallen and left many branches on the trail.  Look back to the bend and you will see the roots of another fallen tree.  Cache is well hidden there - please replace as you found it.  I had originally intended to make the difficulty much higher but after we returned to the parking spot, we were having a hard time getting a fix on the coordinates there, so I worried that with the heavy tree cover the coordinates at the cache might be off a bit too.  So I'm giving you way more info than I had planned.  Please let me know if I've "missed it by a mile".  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alaska yellow cedar is common to Alaska, British Columbia, and west of the Cascades in Oregon and Washington.  There are also a few small, isolated groves in the Siskiyou Mountains of California. However, in the arid mountains of central Oregon, several hundred miles east of the crest of the Cascade range, a 26 acre population has persisted since the Pleistocene– remainders of a time when the climate was wetter and cooler. The Cedar Grove Botanical Trail in the Aldrich Mountains is a must-visit destination in a sojourn across eastern Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Driving directions:  From Highway 26, take FS Rd. 21 (Fields Creek Rd) approximately 9 miles to FS Rd. 2150.  Turn right and travel about 5 miles to the parking spot and trailhead.  &lt;/p&gt;
If you are working on the elevation challenge, approximate elevation is 5900' at the cache site. The trail has a 500' elevation change from beginning to end.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;15 Million Years Ago, the rocks of the Mascall were laid down in a series of wide, level basins following a ferocious volcanic period. The Mascall landscape consisted of several broad basins with lakes and meandering streams that formed atop the last of the Picture Gorge Basalt flows. This cache will take you to a public pull out that faces a road cut. By looking at the road cut and reading the below information, you should be able to answer a few questions. &lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Looking at the road cut, you will notice various layers and colors of soil. These volcanic rock deposits were subsequently covered by successive falls of ash from volcanoes to the west and from the much closer Strawberry volcanics to the east. Alternating between the tuffs (consolidated volcanic ash) are layers of ancient soils and stream deposits that provide evidence of a dynamic floodplain. Many of the vertebrate fossils from the Mascall formation are found in close association with a prominent layer, the 15 million-year-old “Mascall Tuff.” The lava flows, collectively called the Picture Gorge Basalt, formed the walls of the valley.  Twenty million years ago, the Picture Gorge Basalt ash was over one mile deep thru the valley. Through time and erosion, they have exposed older rocks that were once buried by Picture Gorge Basalt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Light colored beds are waterlaid volcanic ash of the Mascall Formation.  Darkened beds come from plant materials in the ancient swamps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions to answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1: Describe the soil in the road cut, do you believe it to be primarily waterlaid volcanic ash or plant based volcanic ash?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2: Looking at the valley and hills around you, how do you think the Picture Gorge Basalt influenced the shape of the valley you are looking at?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3:  What factors do you think caused the erosion of the one mile thick volcanic ash?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BONUS: If you would like, please post a picture of you or your GPS at the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

This is a virtual cache, so there is no container to find.  To log this as a find, go to the posted coordinates and decide what you want to search for.  If you are a traditional cacher, who prefers an opportunity to look for a "diamond in the rough" and have a spirit of adventure... and have a digital camera...Then please find and post a photo of a fossil you found at this site.  You don't have to even TAKE the fossil, just a photo will do.  To be real honest, the fossils I have found here have been quite delicate and don't travel well.  Because this is a public right of way, you CAN collect fossils here, but the less you take the more for the next generation...For those who do not have a camera or the urge to take on the geological "hunt" of looking for fossils... email us the answer to this question:
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;I&gt;What is the title (in bold) on the geological marker, mounted on the large stone?&lt;/I&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
Either way, your choice.   Enjoy the adventure!</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache was intended to be included in the "Second Annual Grant County Fair Event Challenge", however it was not included on the challenge worksheet..  This cache is not  included in the challenge but will remain open for finders.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">According to the sign on the road, you are now on the Malheur National Forest. This forest, established in 1908 by President Taft has 1.7 millions acres of land.  Elevations within the forest range from 4000 ft to 9038 feet.  Land within the forest is primarily within the Blue Mountain range.  I wonder if President Taft knew that the term Malheur, in French, means "misfortune". 

Not known to me until recently is the fact this forest is home to the world's largest organism (by area) the armillaria ostoyae that spans 2200 acres.  Nope, I don't know where it is or what it looks like!!  Maybe someday while geocaching you might run across it!  Please post some coordinates!!

Aside from this little tid bit of information, you are looking for a rubbermaid container with valuable items.</groundspeak:long_description>

This is an interesting location to see once you find the right roads to get here.

I suggest parking at 44:17.012 N  119:21.433 W 

Unless you have a rough terrain rating on your set of wheels.

The cache placement is alright but not one of the better hides as I did not see a reason to get down and dirty on the hide as the location does not warrant it.

Full sized container with swag so trade even and let the kids grab something as well.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Prairie Hill was once home to a ground-mounted L-4 cab built in 1933.&amp;nbsp; It has been gone for many, many decades.&amp;nbsp; Patrol engines still use this vantage point to look for fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Access is off Forest Road 16.&amp;nbsp; The spur road is full of tire-piercing rocks so take it slow and you should be fine.&amp;nbsp; Something with decent ground clearance would be helpful too, or walk from the pavement.&amp;nbsp; This also appears to be a bit of a party spot so make sure the cache is well hidden.&lt;/p&gt;

We were out here on Friday, but had a full load in the little truck, so we decided to wait till today.  We drove the town car out figuring we'd walk if needed.  We got to within .2 miles before deciding it was time to park and walk the rest of the way.  If we'd had the SUV (currently out of commission sniff...sniff...), we'd have driven clear to the top.  

The view is lovely - you can see the Bald Sisters fire still going which is sad, but at least here you're out of the majority of the bug kill area and the trees all look healthy.  

Cache well hidden, but easy to figure out even if the gps tells me I still have 27 ft. to go.  Left a TB in hopes that others will follow.  :D</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This is the 18th in my series of hides near fire lookouts.  Here you will find Calamity Butte Lookout, 6695', in the Malheur National Forest.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Calamity has been home to a fire lookout every summer since 1927.  When you see the view you'll understand why!  The Region 5 (California-style) cabin from 1927 is still there and was in use right up until the newer 50' pole tower with octagonal cab replaced it as primary lookout in the late 1990's.

The lookout is staffed from mid-June through October.  Please only climb the tower if you are invited up.  Remember, this is the lookout's summer home, so please be respectful.  When the fire danger is high, during, and after thunderstorms, the lookout will likely be very busy doing his job, and that is providing early detection to new fire starts.  Oh, and daylight hours only please.

The road up is pretty good up until the last 3/4 mile which gets steep, rough and rocky.  4WD suggested.

The cache is a small, clear snapware container hidden north of the old lookout cabin, out of sight from the newer tower.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache is located on the Malheur National Forest.  The title gives little, well no hints, as to its location.  So, what about the summer of 1969. A little history from the internet.  In January of 1969 Richard Nixon was sworn in to his first term as president.  The movie "Mrs Robinson" and the song "The Dock of the Bay" were big hits.  John Lennnon married Yoko Ono.  In July, the late Ted Kennedy drove off a bridge into a pond after a party.  Oh yes, on July 20, 1969 Neil Armstrong walked on the moon.  In August the famous Woodstock Music and Art fair took place..  The New York Mets  won the world series.On December 8,1969 President Nixon declared victory in Vietnam-six years later Saiagon fell to the communists.

Most relevant to me and this cache is the location due west from where you will find the treasure.  Most likely you will be viewing a bare spot maybe with a remaining wooden fence.  I recall this location is 1969 when I was stationed here, all by myself, for the summer  employed by the forest service.  At that time there were two bunk houses, a cook shack, a bath house and a nice shop.  The forest service over the years has torn down building, moved things around and basically neglected the station.  Recently the buildings were purchased and some have been removed and others are in the process of being prepared for becoming a thing of the past.  

This station started  out many years ago as an outpost for forest service workers.  The first building was described as being similar to a sheep herders trailer on wheels.  It was covered with a canvas top and there was a separate tent next to it.  

I viewed this site with sadness as I hold good memories of my summer there.  I recall listening to the news on a transistor radio the day Armstrong walked on the moon.  Many a night I was awakened by the call of coyotes and during my few trips to town I recall shooting porcupines along the road.  It was a good fire year-that means no fires.  This was also the summer I married my sweetheart.

 This cache has a connection to the Lake Butte Lookout cache as part of my job duties was to carry food and water to the lookout.  The lookout is  since gone but the view is still great.

You are looking for a round container with very few valuables.  Sign the log and take a moment to digest how history changes and valuable things in the past are no longer important.  The summer of 1969 was great; I hope you enjoy the cache.

This cache is located at 4500 feet on a fairly well maintained road.  Common sense should be practiced during times of winter snow.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">About 1885, Andrew and Ellen Ryan, along with their five children (Mike, Mary, Katie, Andrew Jr "Dan", and John) arrived in Fox Valley.  A sixth child, Bill, was born at the family home in 1887.  

Katie died a few years after the family moved to the Fox Valley.  All of the boys homesteaded in Fox Valley.  Dan and Bill are buried at the Fox Valley cemetery.  Andrew Sr. moved to Weiser, Idaho along with son Mike.  This is where the family patriarch was laid to rest in 1916. 

From Highway 395, take Fox Valley Lane/aka FS Road 3950/aka County Road 88 4.7 miles west to the cache.  It is a good gravel road the whole way.  Winter access could be challenging at best.

The road was better than I could've expected so I'm wondering why so few people make the trek out here.  Sure, its gravel.  But its one of the nicest gravel roads I've ever driven on.  
With that in mind, I left a TB in hopes that someone else comes behind and moves it along before the snow flies.  It was 69 degrees out here today - rather cool for August.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">GeoZook Unit #1 found this cache in November 2007. This was the first time for Unit #2 who found it easily and really enjoyed the exploration into the back country. First time to see Bear Creek Meadow. Beautiful! Will come back when the wildflowers are prime as it was pretty dry today. Curious about the enclosure and there has to be a story tied to the shoes &amp; bottle! Will post picture later! TNLN TFTH

It is a very interesting area. Has a nice view and is a nice little stop while just wandering the mountains. 
I would not recommend the family car to get to here as the road got kind of rough, but keep your eyes out for deer as we saw some on our way.
Cache contents are Plug and Play game, DVD, Marbles, Balls, First aid kit, Poncho, decks of cards, putty and a signature item.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache is placed at the Junction of Hwys 26 and 7. This is a favorite spot and has been for many, many years. Gpa came here when he first started elk hunting in the local area 20-25 years ago. (He doesn’t want me to tell my favorite story, so ask him sometime! Hint: it involves a phone booth, a first elk, a bar and a pick up.) We try to stop here when ever we come through. Since we have been caching, Gpa has wanted to put a cache here and now since Rivercacher had his gathering over Memorial Day (2009) we thought we better get it done before someone else does.
The town of Austin was started in the late 1800’s,  Minot and Linda Austin ran a stage line between Sumpter and Canyon City.  Linda ran the general store, hotel and boarding house.  At one time, Austin boasted a population of approximately 500 people.  In about 1917, the Oregon Lumber Company built a new double-sided sawmill about a mile down the Middle Fork of the John Day River from Austin.  A company owned town was built for the mill workers and was named Bates. The mill there was closed down around 1975 and the townsite and mill are mostly just memories.  We know a few people who grew up in Bates. It’s enjoyable to sit by the camp fire and listen to them talk. 
    This is a pretty easy find, you are looking for an Ammo can. It is full of just little trinkets like silly putty. And Gpa threw in some clay pigeons. I put in my Temecula CA geocoin. I was going to turn it loose when my brother was here visiting, but it didn’t happen and now it is time for it to go on its way. There is a bit of digging in the brush but not too bad.
We put in a certificate for 2  ice cream cones for the "first to find" prize. You'll know from where when you find it.  Please enjoy. This cache was placed here with permission.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Someone has been giving me a bad time about not putting out more caches in this area so Red and I went out today, June 27th, 2004, and placed one for him to come and get.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache will be available for most of the year, as long as there is no or very little snow above 6000 feet and the Sun has warmed the draws enough to remove any snowdrift’s.  There is also another cache in this general area you might want to hunt as well.

We came in from Prairie City where we hung a Southeast along the John Day River until we turned  up Deardorff Creek.  Follow Deardorff up and over the ridge of the Blues until you hook up with the North Fork of the Malheur River.  Travel through the high meadows and Lodgepole thickets until you get to Short Creek crossing. Hang a North(left) and take the road towards Unity.  

That is as far as I am going to lead you by the hand. The rest is up to you to figure out. The roads are mostly paved until the very end. 

There where several approaches to getting to the general area of the cache and mostly shanks mare from about 1/3 to 1/2 mile away, depending on your level of risk to your paint job and suspension. 

And yes, Red and I hiked into this one.Fantastic views just getting this far as you travel from which ever direction, be that direction from Unity, Prairie City, Seneca or even Drewsey.  

Just be sure to pack plenty of gear just in case you have a problem in the back country. Food, water, fuel, overnight gear and during Fire Season, you might be required to carry a shovel, ax and a few gallons of water or a fire extinguisher.

The cache is sitting out in the open just waiting for you to get it.  It is a round cookie tin painted a sandy tan color and has several items in it. This is the reason for you to come here. The views are the reason to sit back and enjoy.  We let the 330 sit and average for something like 20 minutes with nothing between it and the stars. That should be a hint in itself.

We retain all rights to this cache. We can and will modify, adjust, tweak, disable or archive this cache at any time without prior notice.  We will not be liable for any direct, indirect, punitive, or consequential damages you may suffer from hunting this cache. If you attempt this geocache hunt, you do so at your own risk. Know your limits and do not attempt to exceed your abilities.</groundspeak:long_description>

Cache is just off a paved road.  Requires movement over rocks and some brush for approximately 30 feet.  Elevation is 3812 feet.  Cache is easily located once you reach the proper coordinates.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The name of the cache may give some clue as to the location and careful observation of non human matters might be of assistance also.  Cache is a camo painted peanut butter jar and contains some playing cards, small kids puzzle, key chains, note pad and assorted items.  This location  was selected because of its uniqueness in the area. I recall first seeing this area in 1966 during my summer in the Grant County area and having come from the flat lands of Mississippi  I was impressed.  Fall colors were  great on date of placement and I recommend a camera to capture the beauty of the area.</groundspeak:long_description>

Almost didn't make it because as I drove by, both the road service crew and the tribe had vehicles parked in the turnout.  When I came back, they were still there but I slowed down and they motioned me through.

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Looking across this creek now you will see the remnants of an old road leading to a small meadow with new pines taking in.  This was once a cabin and home to Bob and Twila.  It was a quaint place with a large old wooden garage and an outhouse, both aged red in color.  As far as my memory serves, the grass was always cut and the area maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never knew Bob and Twila as they lived before my memory, but I will always remember their cabin.  After they passed away their home became kind of a hunting cabin.  During hunting seasons, my Grandpa, father, cousins, relatives and friends (old and new) might meet up here and tell stories and drink around the campfire before the next days hunt.  Good times to be had all around!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For about 15 years, the cabin and surrounding area was maintained by their Son and neighbor, Rick.  Around 2008, the Forest Service asked for the cabin to be demolished and let the forest reclaim the land.  That is what you see before you today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps that was for the best?  I do not rightly know.  I do know that I will always remember this place.  The laughs. The beer, deer and elk. The good times  :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will update this description as I gather more accurate information.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The ghost town of Beech Creek has all but melted back in to the earth.  A few old wooden buildings remain (please do not go exploring inside any of them).  The Beech Creek post office operated from 1900-1955. Some early maps have the site spelled Beach Creek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most curious of all was the establishment in the early 1930s of an emergency fire lookout.  Forest Service maps show a lookout icon to the northwest of the cache, so I suspect it was located on the small hump just north of the fenceline, near the trees.  Having not yet found any photo or solid documented evidence, I would guess this was a simple Osborne firefinder on a stand, similiar to the still-existing one at Prairie City, and used during lightning storms or whenever someone happened to see smoke on the surrounding hills.  In any case, the emergency lookout ceased by the late 1940s and its history, much like the rest of Beech Creek, has faded into the distant past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should be a fairly quick park and grab.  You're looking for a clear, plastic container.  Be sure to cover it back up so it doesn't disappear.  In the winter be prepared to dig it out of the snow.&lt;/p&gt;

in Baker County. This is also placed for purposes of the
&lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=b65a315f-c7a3-46f0-b2bb-4dca07411862"&gt;
OFFLC&lt;/a&gt; cache. Section 5.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Built in 1936 for $676.87, Table Rock Lookout has been going strong
for 72+ years. It is listed on the National Historic Lookout
Register. There's a humorous story to go along with the rich
history of this mountaintop. 
&lt;p&gt;One morning soon after the lookout's construction, the staffer
awoke to find several elephants and camels around the station.
After some eye blinking and rubbing and a little consternation, it
was discovered that a circus troop had bedded down there in the
middle of the night. Seems their van broke down in Unity and the
small cavalcade was trecking cross-country to meet its next
engagement. There are pictures of this event in the historical
files in the Supervisor's Office of the Wallowa-Whitman National
Forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The road is graded the first 6 miles from NFD 13, but gets
consistently rougher the last 5 which is driveable by most medium
clearance vehicles. Table Rock L.O. is well-marked the entire way
up. The lookout building was staffed when the cache was placed, but
the day was cold and damp, so we didn't actually see anyone on
duty. You'll be searching for a camo-painted 4-cup lock-n-lock.
Inside you'll find a logbook, moisture absorber, stash-sheet,
geocoin, and pen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: This cache bisects the Monument Rock Wilderness
established in 1984. Permission was obtained since wilderness
caches require permission to be approved by groundspeak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you, Logscaler!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Out and about this evening and I decided I would place another LOT cache.

This cache is located North of Burns and South of John Day about 15 miles out USFS rd 37 off of Highway 395.

The road is paved about half the way and the last mile could be rough on low clearance rides so be careful if you take the town car out here.

There is still a tower standing as well as two cabins at this site.

Lots of interesting history written on the wall up inside the cabin, which was open when I was there. This is a steel tower with a small cabin on top so things get kinda shaky when you move around.

Your looking for a small ammo can with small goodies inside as well as a logbook and small pen. Bring a writing stick just to be on the safe side.

The skeeters where thick today and a few ticks tried to ride back with me for dinner so be careful on the ground.</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Beautiful day to visit fire lookouts!! No smoke, clear blue skies. This lookout is really amazing. Too bad they don't put it on the rental program. The two cabins are repairable and would be perfect as rentals. We have seen much worse, and harder to get to rentals that are busy all summer! Now the tower is still intact but we are too old to climb that high!!

We walked out to the cache site and had to move a few branches and beer cans, but came up with cache in hand! Signed the almost new log and left a little horse. Afterwards we relaxed and ate our lunch before heading back to Burns.

Thanks for a memorable trip to another fire lookout tower!!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">From the name of the cache you might conclude someone just turned 50.  This cache is placed in honor of GB and the contents contain some interesting facts regarding happenings at the time of his birth. I am hopeful he and family will be the first to find.  The cache container is a camo painted peanut butter jar.  Contents include facts about 1962, some hand warmers, fishing gear, and assorted stuff.  The view from the cache sight is very nice and a camera is recommended.    There is another cache hidden today in the general area.</groundspeak:long_description>

Usually you'll have the place to yourself but if there are any activities going on here you'll need to be discreet.

You're looking for a camo-painted snapware container.  Let your eyes do the looking first, then gently retrieve the cache.  Let's keep this hiding spot looking nice.

Daylight hours only, please.</groundspeak:long_description>

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache's location was chosen in honor of my father in law, DAB.  This was one of his favorite places to go for many reasons.  The view being one of the big ones.  I hope you enjoy it as much as this family has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the road that leads up there has improved over the years, taking a car would not be a wise idea. 4x4 and/or snow shoes would be wise in the winter season if it is accessible at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache has room for goodies/coins. There is a pen in the container but it may be best to bring your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My one and only hint for you is that it is not under the tree with the cross. Please be sure to return the rocks as you found them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache was once GC2ATMH on highway 20 between Burns and Ontario Oregon.  I disabled/archived it as I moved to Florida, then moved to Massachusetts, and finally moved back to good old Oregon.  It has been a long time coming for me to finally place this cache again.  Congrats to those of you who may get to sign the logbook again after all these years&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congrats to WR7X as FTF!&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">This is another entry in my series of hides near fire lookouts. Here you will find Antelope Mountain Lookout, 6456', in the Malheur National Forest.
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Antelope was first used in 1930 with a 30' pole L-4 tower. The present 30' treated timber tower with R-6 flat cab was moved here from &lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=19c0a132-0462-4526-b4e7-4ba9d6448760"&gt;Lake Butte&lt;/a&gt; in the 1970's. It is staffed every summer, usually mid-June though early October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that this is the lookout's summer home. Be respectful and ask permission before climbing up. During and after thunderstorms, and during extreme fire danger, the lookout will likely be very busy doing their job and that is detecting new forest fires before they have a chance to get out of control. Daylight hours only, please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of roads which lead to the area. The mile-long spur road to the lookout is rough and washed out in places, with several rocks to dodge. The road should be snow-free from mid-late May through the first big mountain snowstorm in the Fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Views include the Monument Rock Wilderness to the northeast, Castle Rock the east, Otis Mountain to the south, Calamity Butte Lookout to the southwest, and the Strawberry Wilderness to the northwest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This area of the Forest has been impacted hard by a pine caterpiller/butterfly outbreak the last few years. OPB has a &lt;a href="http://www.opb.org/programs/ofg/segments/view/1807"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; that shows more about the defoliation present in the ponderosa pines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're looking for a camo-painted plastic jar. Please make sure the lid is tight and snapped down.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Crockett Knob was home to a ground-mounted L-4 cabin from 1934 to 1971.  Little remains at the site today except some pieces of cement.  There are 2 reference markers dating from 1938 that point to where the center of the lookout was.

Views include Indian Rock Lookout to the north, Dixie Butte Lookout to the southeast, the Middle Fork John Day River drainage to the south, and on a clear day, Madison Butte Lookout to the west-northwest. 

Seeking this cache requires a 1/2 mile hike up the old jeep road to the summit, with about 200' elevation gain.

You're looking for a camo-painted snapware container which is on the smaller side of the regular sized category.

Cute hide, BTW.  Visible only from one certain direction, even then you have to be determined.  We weren't gonna be skunked by another hide.

This is one of nearly 2,200 such weather stations that report readings every hour. The data is used to calculate fire danger, provide firefighter safety, and help in spot weather forecasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest not driving the jeep road out to the point, and instead park at Antelope Lookout and walk the ridge over to the cache. It's not that far! You're looking for a camo-painted plastic container.&lt;/p&gt;

Each stop has the coordinates to the next location and then under the coordinate it has some numbers to help you unlock the final cache. The first stop is a small magnetic container. The second stop is a new type that I have seen and wanted to try, you will need water (approximately 17 oz.) for this stop. The final is in an ammo can with some trades that are mostly for kids!! The sign for this road says it is not recommended for passenger cars, we took our CRV and we were fine, in fact it is a really nice road for most vehicles.&lt;br /&gt;

Nice hide, cache is in good condition although the closure on the ammo can is different from others I've seen so it took a bit for me to figure out.  Still, contents in good condition, all clean and dry.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">We had just came out of the Indian Rock cache and where trying to figure out which way to go once we hit the asphalt again.  Red flipped a coin and we headed right, down river towards Ritter, and we where on our way.  Then she spotted a sign and we made a little side trip up a steep gravel Road. Cars should be able to get in and out without too much trouble but be careful anyway.The road dead ends in a large wide parking spot or you will see several parking locations as you go in towards the end.I tried to locate some local information about the townsite but the best I could come up with was for Susanville, about 2 miles away.
 (visit link) Anyway, the cache is a small cookie tin with a couple goodies and a logbook.  It is not hidden very hard, just hard enough to keep prying eyes away from it in most cases. While we where here, we spotted a nice little buck bedded down about 75 yards out. We where here about an hour and he stayed there the whole time, just watching us and flipping his ears at the bugs. We also spotted Deer and Elk tracks all around.  There could be snakes here but we did not see any.

I placed this toward the back of the park, near where the highway used to be.

There's a restroom (in season).  You'll encounter barricades at the entrance during the off-season, but you can still walk back to the cache.  This will be a difficult find in winter (depending upon snow depth, you may not be able to park at the turnoff in the winter).

You're seeking a lock-n-lock with logbook and swag.  It's pretty simple and straight-forward.</groundspeak:long_description>

Just getting to the parking lot will be an adventure you might not wish to do as it will require a high clearance rig and possible a 4x4, depending on your ride. Mine went in without a problem.

To locate this area, you will need to turn South off Highway 20 at the 136 Mile Marker and get ready for 5.4 miles of rough.  The easy part is done with shortly past the corrals and as you head up the first rise.

Once - (IF) - you get to the parking spot, and you will know it by the fence, gate and large sign, then you will be on the trail to the Aldrich Ponds area. I had it at around 5 miles in and out, depending on your route of road or trail.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Aldrich Mountain and it's lookout can be found in one of the least known areas of Oregon.  The Aldrich mountain range can be seen along the south side of US Hwy 26 between Dayville and Mount Vernon in east central Oregon.  The mountain and the lookout are on the western end.

The incredible views from the top include the vast stretches of the Malheur forest and Strawberry mountains to the north, east and south.  To the west is the South Fork John Day river drainage.  The river marks the divide between the Malheur and Ochoco national forests.  Wolf Mountain lookout is just 13.5 miles to the west.

The July flowers were out in full force when we visited.  We had a great chat with Marty.  He and his wife are manning the lookout this summer.  Be sure to say hi.

The lookout was built in 1960 to replace an identical one built the year before and immediately burned.  It has two cabins, one on top and one underneath.  They actually have a guest bedroom, although not for rent.  Marty says that there was another original site 200' to the west and there is evidence to support that.  

For more information, see Rex's fire lookouts.

http://www.firelookout.com/or/aldrichmtn.html

To get there, find forest road 21, about half way between Dayville and Mount Vernon and go south up Fields Creek about 9-10 miles.  Turn right onto a well maintained dirt road (2150) and go 15 miles to the parking lot.  It is good road the whole way in the summer.  From the parking lot, it is less than a 1/4 hike to the lookout tower.  Cache is closer.

Enjoy your outing.</groundspeak:long_description>

We drove from the Izee highway, past woodcutters and hunters, without a hitch.  One of the best lookout tower roads we've seen so far.  Oh, and if you need it, the "facilities" on site are available to use, but bring your own tp.  :D
We found 3 different benchmarks at the site, so I photographed them all.  Wish I knew how to log them.

Cache is in good condition although the container has been covered in retardant so it is now speckled orange.  Took some stickers and left a few baubles.   The log shows a signer in 2013 and one in January of 2014 although neither have logged at the website.

Elevation is, I believe, 6890'.

Thanks for the cache!

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">6,328-foot Black Rock is a beautiful, castle-like basaltic peak in the Malheur National Forest about 20 miles NNE of Burns, Oregon, as the crow flies.  If you’re driving from Burns to John Day, you can spot it from U.S. highway 395 at mile post 48, looking east.

There are two ways to get there.  From U.S. 395, turn east at about mile 42½ onto USFS Road 2840 and drive 5.3 miles to FS Road 28.  Go right (south) 4.5 miles, where you turn right again onto a road (marked 354 on the topo map) that goes west toward Black Rock.  Another way to get to this turn-off is to drive 14 miles east of Burns on U.S. 20, and turn left (north) on Rattlesnake Rd. and drive 18.7 miles, the first 12 miles of which is paved.

Here’s where the USGS topo map (Telephone Butte, Oregon) will be helpful.  In dry weather you can drive 2.0 miles from FS 28 (5,440 ft.) to the ridge south of Black Rock (6,100 ft.).  It’s a pretty good road, with one steep section, a few scattered rocks to dodge, and a couple of boggy areas that can make 4-wheel drive a good idea.

The ridge leading north to the Black Rock summit is rocky, but if you skirt the rocks by working your way down to the right, it’s easy hiking (about .4 mile) through juniper, mahogany, and sagebrush to the base of the high cliff.  From a distance the cliff face looks formidable, and perhaps it’s not for the faint of heart; but I stayed to the right (east) and found a fairly easy route to the top.  Climbing down is almost always harder than climbing up, but this route proved to be an easy descent.  Nevertheless, be safe!  Don’t tackle it if it’s beyond your abilities.

The summit itself is a great place to experience; and the view is, I’m sure, terrific—Castle Rock to the east, Strawberry Mt. to the north, the Steens to the South, etc.  Unfortunately, I couldn’t see any of them because it was snowing hard when I got to the top.

The cache is a 4-inch ABS pipe with a screw-on cap.  After you’ve logged in, screw on the cap just snug; if you crank it down too tight, it will be hard for the next finder to open.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;Approach is from FSR 3125.&amp;nbsp; You&amp;#39;ll need to park and walk almost 1/2 mile with about 200&amp;#39; elevation gain.&amp;nbsp; Look for the sign for the now defunct 240 spur road.&amp;nbsp; Someone took an aweful lot of time to make sure no one will ever drive (or walk) up to the summit via the road again, so I found it easier to eventually just go cross-country through the open timber on the west slope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re looking for an ammo box.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">We said we were not going to come up here again unless we saw elk. Of course that was before I had the bright idea of placing a cache in this very spot.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Oh well, I have been able to get 3 other people to follow me up here, let’s see how many more of you will make the trek. Yes, it was November and I was elk hunting when I placed the cache. Yes, it was sub-zero temperatures with the wind chill. Yes, it is located on top of the mountain at 7400ft elevation (according to my GPS). Yes, I have been accused of being short a few brain cells. No, the cache is not difficult to find...once you have reached ground zero that is.

Depending on how you choose to approach this cache you will be 1 – 2 miles away from it as the crow flies, but make no mistake about it, this is not going to be a Sunday stroll you will want to take with the kids. Make sure you have good hiking footwear, water, maybe a snack or two, definitely bring a camera because the view is awesome, and make sure you have 3 – 6 hours to spend on this depending on your level of fitness. No special climbing gear is needed. My dad, at 60 years old, and I have done the trek twice. I have provided coords for the parking area we used.  Happy hiking!!

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The buildings before you are known as the Izee school and grange.  For many years this area was the hub of the ranching community and many people still living in the  county attended the Izee school.  The Grange was the center of social life and I wonder what stories could be told about the good ole days or parties, dances and big social events.  

The Izee school is in Grant School District #3 and students, upon completion of lower grades at Izee had the option of busing into John Day to attend Grant Union High School or going to the Paulina School.

Nearby these building you will see the Izee cemetery which is the final resting place for many of Izee settlers.

You are looking for a rubbermaid container which is easy to find.  Remember the POSTED sign!  The Cache is easily found without trespassing.</groundspeak:long_description>

You're looking for a camoed snapware container.  Be sure to hide it well so it doesn't walk away.

The cache is at an elevation over 5000' so may be tricky in the winter.  Spring and summer the mosquitoes will likely enjoy the free meal you will provide.  Ticks will surely be out too.  Also watch out for the rare but speedy traffic.  There is a good sized pullout that is trucker friendly.</groundspeak:long_description>

Container: Ammo can

After work with nothing to do so I went out to Vinegar Hill to the old lookout tower location.

39.25 miles from downtown John Day. 
16.8 miles from Austin Jct.
13.25 miles on Forest road 2010, a washboard covered gravel road that turns to dirt 7.5 miles up.  There is a turn around - parking spot 7 miles up. DO NOT GO PAST THIS SPOT WITH YOUR TOWN CAR UNLESS YOU CAN BACK UP OR DON'T GIVE A R.A. ABOUT YOUR RIDES PAINT/UNDERCARRIAGE.

5.7 miles from the top is the magic number.  This is where the rock runs out.  Well, the gravel rock anyway.  The oversize starts here and goes most of the way to the top.

You will need a four wheel drive, a off road buggy, dirt bike, mountain bike or shanks mare to get in and out. I was in 4 wheel drive BOTH directions. Low range and first gear in lots of places.  If it rains, snows or a cow lifts it tail in the road, it will get worse.

Anyway, this is a great place to get away from it all.  Even with smoke in the air, I could see Mount Jefferson, the Elkhorns, The Wallowa Mtn's, Dixie Mtn. and a flock of other knobs. 

The Bench mark is missing but there is a rebar with a plastic cap in place as well as reference # 2.  There is also a Summit Log under the Red Coffee can.

Also, take a look at what they used to anchor the tower with.  Looks like old mine cart track chunks all chinked together with concrete.

Be careful looking for this cache as I hid it where no muggles should go but a cacher will. Please replace it back deep and covered. Yes, it will fit if you work it right.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Sugarloaf has been in use as a fire detection post since 1932 and is staffed every summer.

Please only climb the tower if you have been invited up.  Remember, this is the lookout's summer home.  During high fire danger, and during and after thunderstorms, the lookout will likely be very busy doing their job.  Daylight hours only, please.

There are several approaches to this area, check your maps before you go and fill up your tank, it's a long way to civilization from here!  You can drive all the way to the top when the lookout is in use.  A recently installed gate may be closed and locked on the lookout's days off and during the off-season to ward off vandalism.  If this is the case, it will add about a 1/3 mile walk up.

You're seeking a plastic snapware container with logbook and trades.  I wouldn't even try this in the winter.</groundspeak:long_description>

We drove our town car all the way to the top with just a little bit of wiggling around to make the grade.

Another view to spoil normal geocaching.

We did not go all the way to the top as it looked like the trap door was down, saying keep away.

Quick and easy find on the cache today.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache was placed in a spot that everyone needs to see. The view from here is magnificent. It is at the end of forest service road 4500/537 or better known as Indian Rock lookout road.

To get here you will need to travel the Middle Fork of the John Day river road east from state hwy 395 at Ritter Jct. or west from state hwy 7 at Austin Jct. 

At milepost 14 on the middle fork road you will need to turn north on road 45. 

It is approximately 10 miles to the 4500/537 jct that leads you to Indian Rock lookout. 

After parking at the end of the 537 spur road it is just a short walk to the cache. The cache is now an ammo can. (It originally was two 35 mm film canisters taped together with a logbook only inside.)  

You will not be disappointed at the view from here.  </groundspeak:long_description>

Anyway...I convinced the hubby to take us to Indian Rock and see the Fire  Lookout while looking for bear...we were not disappointed! Not only was it an amazing view...but we also got to meet the lady of the lookout and sign the guest book after finding the cache below. I left her a love rock and was excited  to get a rock in return...thankyou so much! I also left a love rock in the cache...dont know what a love rock is...facebook love rocks! This would be an awesome place to stay except for in a lightning storm and carrying things up the hill from the parking area below! Great way to stay in shape though! Definitely will be adding as one of my favorites! Thanks so very much for the 😊 and happy caching 😎

Walked on up to the lookout before finding the cache and chatted with the summer resident and enjoyed the views. We were the first sign ins  for 2014! What an awesome view!

At over 6300 feet elevation, it is touted as Oregon highest incorporated City. There used to be a sign about the history of this town, but it seems to have disappeared. I also looked for the graveyard that showed on my map without luck. If anyone finds it, let me know or put out a cache there.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Greenhorn was first populated in the 1860's as a gold mining town. It's population went down 2/3 between 1902 and 1910. It was still a viable community until gold mining became illegal in 1942. The Greenhorn mountains were estimated to have produced over $3 million in gold in both placer and ore mining, and there are many evidences of past mining in and around Greenhorn itself. The cache is near, but not at, a city limits sign.&lt;/p&gt;

The access road is smooth going until the last 3/4 mile or so, then it's muddy and rocky to the summit.  I wouldn't suggest trying this one in the winter.

Getting here was a different story! We had plotted it out on Google earth but the route took us to a locked gate on private property! We dug out the old trusty Forest Service map and found a way to get back to the correct road. The way wasn't much more than an ATV trail but the 4Runner made it!! Once on the correct road the rest was easy. 

Thanks again for a fun cache and bringing us to another standing tower!! :)</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Another old Fire tower lookout location in Grant County.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">A short trip after work today up to this location.  Somewhere around a hour and a half from John Day or Baker City should get you here okay.

I strongly advise high clearance and four wheel drive just in case it is needed. I bottomed out my ride in a couple holes today just getting in and out as well as it was real muddy from the recent rains.  Lots of donickers sticking up to get your attention as well as a lot of brush alongside the road and a few trees bucked open to really make it interesting.

I was going to post some coordinates for turns and parking but decided you might need the experience of navigation in the back country.  I will say the last 1.4 miles is not for the town cars or light weight SUV's hence the higher rating. You will know when to stop towards the end. (Trust me, this is NOT the road for a town car.)

From the parking spot to the cache is only about a 15 minutes walk up a gentle grade to the old parking spot for the lookout. Well, most of the way. One little pitch, not so much.

Your looking for a well hidden cache can.  The reason for the well hidden part was due to the empty beer cans there so I know people come up here. Please hide it where (if) you find it.</groundspeak:long_description>

We found our way up going through some thick brush starting on the SE side, then coming up on the NE side. We ended up making it up all the way to the top parking lot on our ATV's, not bad, considering there was 4 of us in their 70's &amp; the oldest one almost 80! The coords kept leading us a little to the N, but we were glad to make the find. This is when caching is at it's best, taking you somewhere you would have never known about, thanks for adding to our awesome experience! [^] Uploading a pic we found online of one of the towers that used to be here.... p.s. We left the easier way out! Team Rancher rides again!

Other info: The first lookout here was a 43' pole platform set up in the 1920s. This was replaced in 1934 with a 22' wooden L-4 tower, which in turn was replaced in 1949 with a 41' treated timber L-4 tower, used for emergency in the 1960s and is now gone.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We were operating from a week-old printout and did not realize that the coordinates and location had been changed.  We looked for 20 minutes and then I gave up.  However, Mrs. TillaMurphs was persistent.   I told Mrs. TillaMurphs she was crazy to keep looking and then I went off to explore the area to look remnants of the lookout house.  Another 20 minutes later and she shouted: “Found It!”.  I still can’t believe she found it since it was not near the original coordinates.

After observing that the container was brand new and was not a Gatorade bottle we surmised that changes must have been made since our printout.  We confirmed that was the case after we returned to civilization.

Logscaler and Red, thanks for replacing the original destroyed cache.  After all the work we spent getting up here, it was great to not leave empty-handed.

We took a nail kit (well it was MRS. TillaMurphs who made the find) and left a LED clip-on spotlight.

We found this driving up from one side of the summit.  In our full size 4x4 we drove until the road was blocked off with a trench-mound.  It would take an ATV or very high clearance 4x4 to pass this point.  We walked the last 0.9 miles on the road to the cache – it was a very nice walk.  A few days later we found a road in from the opposite side that was a better road and would have reduced the walking portion by about half.

Thanks Logscaler and Red!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Here you will find the remains of an earlier lumber mill in  the area.  Certainly lacking the modern equipment found in a mill today but I suspect lots of quality lumber came from this site.  Today you might find a cow or two in the area.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">As you look for this one, give some thought to how this mill supported this rural part of Grant County and how it must have been to work in such a location.  Heck, you can't even go to McDonald's for a quick cup of coffee.  I assume but don't know for sure there may have been some living quarters on this site also.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Really cool spot.  I can't imagine a functioning mill so far from civilization.  Still a lot of lumber piles from what I would assume are fallen buildings.  Nothing left standing which is unfortunate.  

As to the cache itself, it was full of medicine.  I would've taken it out, but I didn't have much to put in its place, so maybe the next time you're out this way (HA!) you can restock the poor thing.  

Still a great stop and we were glad to have a chance to see some more of Grant County's history.  TYFC!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Trebuchet MS"&gt;A quick stop on the south side of Hwy 26 -roughly 1.6 miles east of Dayville- to whet your appetite for the JDRV experience. Of course, if you're traveling east, this would be dessert!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Trebuchet MS"&gt;The rimrock that you see to the north is a volcanic ash flow about 5 million years old. The ash erupted as red-hot pumice, highly charged with gas, which flowed like very dry fine sand; it probably filled the ancient John Day River Valley to a depth of more than 100 feet over a distance of 60 to 70 miles. When movement ceased, the center of the flow was still so hot that the glossy particles of pumice were partly melted or welded together to form a hard rock called welded tuff.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Trebuchet MS"&gt;The steep dark slopes below the rimrock were formed by gravels deposited before the eruption. The rounded hills about the tuff are gravels which were deposited after the eruption. The tuff is thin or missing over large areas where it has been stripped away by erosion. The gravels and tuff together make up the Rattlesnake Formation.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Trebuchet MS"&gt;The John Day River Valley originated as a downwarp when the Aldrich and Strawberry Mountains were raised by movements of Earth's crust. Many thousands of feet of rocks were eroded away, especially from the soft Mascall Formation, before the first gravels of the Rattlesnake Formation were deposited. When deposition of the Rattlesnake Formation was completed, the ancient John Day River was about 1000 feet higher than at present and occupied a valley 6 to 7 miles wide. The present narrow valley, ranging up to 1 1/2 miles in width, probably was carved by the river within the last 500,000 years.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Trebuchet MS"&gt;Email me with the correct answers to the following:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;font face="Trebuchet MS"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
1. How much tuff is exposed in the cliff?&lt;br /&gt;
2. The light-coloured slopes below the Rattlesnake gravels sit on ash beds of what considerably older formation?&lt;br /&gt;
3.Optionally, feel free to post a shot of yourself with either the formation or the &lt;i&gt;non-informational side of the boulder&lt;/i&gt; in the background.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;* Do not post your answers here. Logs containing answers will be unceremoniously deleted.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Today...I was lucky to get the hubby to make one quick stop while passing through Greenhorn...so I could grab a cache...lucky me! I always love visiting Greenhorn...and the Sumpter area...so much history! I was surprised to see there are some old cabins being fixed up...a ghost town that still lives!

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;#39;s journey started at Dayville and followed the South Fork Rd. all the way to Izee. &amp;nbsp;There seemed to be a long stretch of road without any hides, so when we stopped to eat our lunch here, we looked up and saw the rocks and figured it was as good as any other place to put one. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cache is a camo&amp;#39;d peanut butter container, at the base of a burned ponderosa, in the rocks. &amp;nbsp;Seeing that ponderosa up close and personal really brought home the damage this past summer&amp;#39;s fire season has done in this area. &amp;nbsp;I hope these trees survive and more come up behind them. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to know before you travel out here: &amp;nbsp;the road is not maintained during the winter, and this hiding spot is on the side of road that is part of the ODFW wildlife winter range area. &amp;nbsp;This year the lack of snow has made it accessible, but most years you won&amp;#39;t be able to get here until at least April 1st, which is when the winter range closure is lifted. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Hopefully, this is just the first installment of a series of Forts of the Ochoco.  Fort Lincoln (named for Abe)was established on March 20, 1864 and was reduced to ashes within the following month (by the original Chief Paulina).  It was an exciting month, to say the least.  
&lt;P&gt;
I have left copies of some pages from Gale Ontko's 'Thunder over the Ochoco' in the cache.  Please take the time to read this while sitting in the 'Officer's quarters'.  It is worth the time.  While up here, take the time to travel down the S. fork.  Lots of wildlife and fish.  Fantastic bluffs to climb.  
&lt;P&gt;
Enjoy

Red and I where heading to this cache on the way to repair another one of ours.

As we turned the corner, we seen people standing there holding the cache box and reading things.

We where going to pass it by but then we talked about the next time we would be in the area.

We back up, got out and chatted with the people who where there already.

Muggles.

They had found the cache already, sitting out in the open.

We chatted with them, explained geocaching to them and then we signed the logsheet.

As I replaced the cache, my thinking was I would find some more cover material for it.

Nothing close enough and small enough to move so I hope for the best with this cache.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Those items you see are there for a purpose.  Although  they might look like dowels or stray arrows, they are actually shouts of trees, likely willow, which have been planted deep along the bank to, in the future, provide shade for the stream. This shade over the water provides for less evaporation and improved living conditions for little creatures in the stream.  A technical name for this work is riparian area restoration.  Return here in a few years and you will be surprised how the stream bank looks.\

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">All these spots along the highway are interesting.  Wonder what trees they will grow up to be?  Its hard to tell just looking at them.   
The cache container is showing its age.  The edges are broken, and it was hard to snap the lid back on.  Plus, the contents were too large for the small container.  That said, we pretty much left it as we found it, didn't take anything out.  

Thanks for another smiley!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Yellowjacket Lake has been a popular local place to camp.  My family has been coming here since the 60's.  I have lots of wonderful family memories here.  I encourage your family to make your own memories!&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;We hid the cache on January 1, 2014 in honor of the new year.  In most years the snow is deeper.  However, this year there is not much snow but with the cold, it was a perfect day for ice fishing. In the summer, the lake is great to swim, camp, boat, hike and fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is an ammo box located on an isolated knoll just above the natural dam within a rocky outcrop.  You can park at the upper campground area near the creek (south side of the Lake) and follow the trail over the creek toward the natural dam.  It is an easy trek to the cache however, there is a hill to the top of the knoll.  My 5 year old grandson helped me hide it.  If you like to fish, we stashed a lure in the cache that has been a winner in catching many trout in the local areas.&lt;/p&gt;

If you don't need electrical hookups then this is a very quiet &amp; pretty place to camp with a little stream that runs along the campground. After pitching your tent or getting your RV placed in just the right spot head on up the hill for this cache and my other one too! Make sure to bring some bottled water with you! This is my most challenging &amp; also prettiest cache spot to date.

The cache is hidden in 2 qt. cammo container. As always when in the mountains, keep an eye out for Poision Ivy and make sure you check for ticks before leaving to go home!  Have fun [:)]

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Here is another entry in my series of hides near fire lookouts.  This is Craft Point Lookout, 6025', in the Malheur National Forest.
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Craft Point was established as a lookout post in 1930 when the present 15' pole observation tower was constructed.  It likely served as an emergency detection point since the site was never upgraded and was promptly abandoned in the 1940's.  Please do not attempt to climb the tower remains, just appreciate it from the ground.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From Forest Road 28, take the 2815 to the east.  Follow this until you get to the 046 spur.  Take it to the listed parking coordinates, which is where it becomes a closed road.  There is no formal trail to the summit, although you'll encounter many cow trails along your journey.  Head southeasterly from the parking spot, staying on or west of the ridge the whole way (there is a range fence which follows the ridgeline).  The route is fairly open, minimal bushwacking required, although you'll need to navigate lots of loose rocks, and do a short rock scramble as you approach the last stretch.  Distance from parking to summit is about 8/10 mile with 400' elevation gain.  You may be able to get up here from other directions as well, but that's totally up to you! You're looking for a camo-painted snapware container.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well besides the road being blocked with fallen tree's it was a great cache. Drove the truck as far as I could then walked in until the GPS told me that the cache was 2/10's then it was straight up to the cache. Its amazing how you always find a better path on the way down.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Myself and the Emigrant Creek Heritage Crew had to come up here to monitor the lookout. So we decided to find the geocache as well. The cache did have a hole in the lid so we slipped it into a 1 gallon ziplock bag we had. Coordinates were fine though. The hike to the top can be a grueling hike if you aren't ready. But we did see 30 head of elk and a couple of nice Mule deer. Thanks for the FTF!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;While traveling down Olive Creek road, I spotted this usual creature. One always hears how the amphibians are especially susecptible to pollutants and changes in the environment. It made me wonder if all the mining activity caused this creature's robust size.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;I oversized bison tube along a gravel road near an usual creation. Might be interesting to get in winter unless you like to dig in snow.&lt;/p&gt;
