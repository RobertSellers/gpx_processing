</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Reason number 112 for living in Central Oregon:  warm, sunny days in January that encourage us to get out of the house.  This was one of those days and with the extended forcast looking good...we decided to place a cache to celebrate.  We loaded up some tupperware with a few items you might want to take along to the river and dropped it in the woods near the Deschutes.  Being a Skadog however, this is not going to be your typical Sunriver area "grab and go," but it doesn't have to be difficult either.  At the listed coordinates you will...some of you will find the coordinates for the cache which is less than .21 away, so whether it takes you five minutes or five hours, just depends on how you look at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please CITO&lt;/p&gt;

They had fun jumping in and out of the river and bolting through the trees. Something caught my eye as I remembered the hint. Looked and there it was. I"M A BIG FAT CHEATER! Took two of the TB's to move over to Long Beach WA this weekend. Going to get me some clams. Thanks skadog for the fun.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Found it. Hoped to get here last week but had unfinished business in the Badlands. Made it today thinking that the only way in would be from the Benham falls road. Slopped our way through the back roads, zig-zagging our way to the first waypoint. Got all the way to the river then strapped on our cleats and headed off. Found the invisable wp fairly quickly. Gave up on the GPS and searched for the final high and low... it magicly appeared after sitting relaxing, and enjoying the view!  On the way out we decided to go the other way because of the  amount of tracks on the road, which lead us to the easy way out in record time, figures. TFTMC SL</groundspeak:text>

Once at the site take a little time to explore. There is a point of interest at N 44.55.319 / W 121.27.023 called Cinder Station. Hunt around the bushes a bit and you will find some survey markers and tree tags having to do with Sunriver back in 1972. You can also hook up with a nice horse/bike trail that comes from Benham Falls all the way to Sunriver, if you look slightly north of the cache.

On the under side of the ammo can lid are coordinates for a bonus cache called "Grey Burp Bonus". The coords are also listed on the front and back pages of the log book.

Have fun!</groundspeak:long_description>

However, you can't drive to the gate anymore and the road is very faint until you get passed some barriers.  Just makes it a long walk and more cross country until you find the road.  Once you find the road you will find the Gate.

We thought we could drive out to this one somehow but the closest we could get was .5 miles. Found the road after getting past the barriers and jogged out to the red dot. Didn't have any trouble finding the container or grabbing the coords for the Grey burp. SL. TFTH</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;span&gt;This is the sixth of the Bike Me series in Sunriver. Sunriver is one of our favorite places to spend time. We love walking and biking along the 30+ miles of pathways throughout the Sunriver resort area. We hope you enjoy the area as much as we do.&lt;/span&gt;
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located near Circle 7.  From Sunriver Bike Me #5, you can reach this cache by heading towards Circle 6 and taking either the Kinglet Loop and picking up Sunriver Bike &amp;amp; Rest, or following along West Cascade Road on the path directly towards Circle 7.  This location has a road and trail map kiosk.  You are looking for a bison tube.  This should be accessible all four seasons.  Just a few steps off the path. There is no need to bushwhack. Bring a scribble stick to sign the log.  Even though you can get a car very near this cache, there is no roadside stopping or parking in Sunriver.  Please use caution.&lt;br /&gt;
NOTE: Path is busier in the summer months. Please use care when removing and replacing this cache. Please replace it as you found it. Thanks

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">You can either ride a horse into the area or hike.  The horse trail from the SunRiver stables is right along this path. 
You can also get there by floating the river.  It is a gorgeous place to stop.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">You can rent a rubber raft or canoe at the SunRiver rentals at the River House location on the Deshutes near the airport. 

Please take caution when doing this cache as it is beautiful but you are in natures surroundings. 
 
If you float the river your GPS will give you plenty of time to navigate and pull over to the bank as you come around a bend in the river.  You will see the location from the river. 
The cache is up hill from the rivers edge. 

You will be looking for a brown container in a baggy which is under bark and a log at that area.  
Whcih if it is under the weather would you please help it out---THANK YOU! 
There will be plenty of time in this secluded area to sit down and add your names to the geocache log book and plenty of time to enjoy stamping in the log book that is contained there for the letterbox.  Our rabbit stamp is enclosed in this letterbox/cache for using in your stamp journal.  Find our letterbox listing at:  www.atlasquest.com

When you find this please rehide very well and brush your tracks.  Try to keep the paperwork dry if the weather gets bad.  It snows a lot here some years.

Please do not leave food here or leave any trash.  
Thanks for being so careful in our forest.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This is an easy (training) cache for Sunriver visitors. It is located on typical high desert terrain.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The cache is a clear, plastic, Rubbermaid container. The best way to get to this cache is to walk or bike. If you have to drive, note that parking is not permitted on any Sunriver streets. You can park just north of the gate posts on the gravel road that leads to the Sunriver canoe pickup. This is near Circle 7 at N 43 54.850, W 121 26.209. From this parking spot, you can then travel slightly north and then walk or mountain bike east on the National Forest dirt roads. 

Thanks to Tucker's Trio for the inspiration for this cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;The four Benham Caches (Fort Benham, Benham View, Benham Falls, and Benham 
  Bonus) are located on the Benham Buttes which are a group of 1.8 million year 
  old rhyodacite domes. Access to the area is from the road to West Benham Falls 
  trailhead. There are some roads into the area but the area is posted as no motorized 
  vehicles so please respect the closure. Many of the roads overgrown but still 
  make great hiking or biking trails. The first three caches can be done individually 
  or all at the same time as part of a 5 mile loop. To do the Benham Bonus cache 
  you must do the other three first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A = Bonus number from Fort Benham Cache&lt;br&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">1 and 2 of 6 are spending a week in Sunriver celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary.  We thought the Benham cache series would be a great way to spend some of our time.  We were right.  The weather was perfect for caching (mid-50s with partial sunshine) and there were no mosquitoes to be found anywhere.  Since it is before Memorial Day weekend, crowds were nonexistent and we had practically the whole area to ourselves.  Referencing a topo map before starting toward this one was a really good idea; we might have given up if we didn't know where we were headed.  Other cachers indicated they took the hard way up and found an easier way down.  Could we find the easy way up too?  Nope.  We took another look at the topo map after we were back from our day of caching and had a "duh!" moment, but hindsight is 20-20.  Bushwhacking to the cache was still rather fun and oh so much easier than other places (these bushes don't bite).  Cache is hard to hide really well but seriously, how many muggles are going to stumble into this one?  TNLNSL.  TFTF</groundspeak:text>

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;While checking on some caches along the paved trail; decided to see if "No One But Us Chippys" was walkable from the new paved trail. Yes it is, plus there is room for an added cache or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dirt trail is wide and flat. Do not know if it will be muddy during our wet season. It is hard packed so it should be OK.&lt;/p&gt;
A person can get a good walk by parking at the trail head; getting several caches; turning on trail 9702 612 about 200 ft past Sunriver Bike Me (extended) #6.5. After grabbing this cache,; continue to get the Chippys cache. You are looking for a small peanut butter plastic jar wrapped in electricians tape.

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Another Bench With A View (Well, Kinda).  If you enjoy watching tennis matches or want a very quiet place to sit and relax when there is no tennis match happening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a "park and grab" as you can drive right up to the bench.  Or if on a bike ride, just a short ride off the trail. And if hiking, what's a few more feet, eh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty Easy Peasy Cache.  Me thinks. &lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is just out side the Sunriver boundary along a newly paved path that connects Benham Falls/Lava Lands to Sunriver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way is no longer that dusty trail, but is a nicely graded and paved new path. It is now much easier to walk or cycle out here. One will pass a few nice caches along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The container is a small lock and lock container. It is not a NANO! :) No need to wander more than 30 feet off the edge of the paved shoulder of the path.&lt;/p&gt;
Congratulations to CougNeff for the FTF!!

We were able to drive a little closer to this one than the red dot but I was pretty tired from jogging to the last one and walked the whole way out to the Grey burp (excellent name! ). I really enjoyed the climb up to the cache but getting back down was a bit sketchy. Managed to survive the ordeal and ink the log. This one definitely gets a favorite. SL. TFTH</groundspeak:text>

Thanks so much for putting these out, markellie!</groundspeak:text>

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Cache is a large cammo wrapped plastic jar. 

We found this undocumented container while looking for the now archived, "Anglers' Rest". The container is a large cammoed plastic bottle. Inside is the old log with signatures that go back a few years. Now that this cache has a new name &amp; new GC code, the fisrt to log after this date can claim a First To Find. Had more fun scoping out the availability of this cache than participating in Black Friday or Cyber Monday. Cache will be found about 70 feet from closest bench.

The "Angler's Rest" cache had the following description, which remains pertinent:
"This cache is found near the angler's rest along the Deschutes River and close to the bike bath that intersects with Warbler Lane. From Circle 6 travel North and West toward the river along the bike bath, cross Warbler Lane and then stop near the benches along the river. This location is one of our family's favorite places to visit while we are in Sunriver."

There is no need to bushwhack. Bring a scribble stick to sign the log.  There is a nearby side road that might provide some parking, but there is no roadside parking in Sunriver.  Please use caution.&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Geocachers are map experts but I'll lend a hand. From road 41 turn east onto road 4100/280. Follow it to 43 54.809-121 27.603 and turn east. Follow that road to the given parking coordinates/trail head. The trail is a horse trail so one could also come across the bridge from Sunriver to get this one. 

Hope that's easy enough.

I was upset that I had forgotten to bring the camera because the views were great even with the clouds. As usual, the cache hounds enjoyed their walk with us. It didn't take Slow very long to find the cache. Thanks for the find.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Missy dog &amp; I recently finished Volcanoguy's excellent Benham series of multis, which we highly recommend.  During one of our scouting trips for those caches (read: we didn't find it that day) we found a road that beckoned us.  Today, a crisp late autumn day, we walked up that road, about an hour round trip. The hide isn't special, just a way to get some exercise in a beautiful chunk of forest.  There may indeed be a way to access that road from somewhere else, but we wanted a nice walk.  This cache should be accessible via mountain bike, x-c skis, and snowshoes, too.</groundspeak:long_description>

The part that isn't on roads is nice open forest with easy walking. A little more than 2 miles round trip, a little more than 200 ft. gained. 

I did this one pre-Benham, rather than post. Found it very close to Big Eddy's coords. Cache was in good shape after so long with no love. Proudly put down my name and trotted back to my ride. Thank you for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is a multipoint cache with 3 intermediate points before the cache is reached. The starting coordinates are for parking spot along the the West Benham Falls road. &lt;/p&gt;
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The four Benham Caches (Fort Benham, Benham View, Benham Falls, and Benham Bonus) are located on the Benham Buttes which are a group of 1.8 million year old rhyodacite domes.  Access to the area is from the road to West Benham Falls trailhead.  There are some roads into the area but the area is posted as no motorized vehicles so please respect the closure.  Many of the roads overgrown but still make great hiking or biking trails.  The first three caches can be done individually or all at the same time as part of a 5 mile loop.  To do the Benham Bonus cache you must do the other three first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The motivation for this cache was to find the location of Fort Benham, which 
  I first visited as a kid in 1956. This fort was built for the filming of the 
  1955 movie “&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048204/"&gt;The Indian Fighter&lt;/a&gt;” 
  starting Kirk Douglas. The fort was built under a Special Use Permit from the 
  Deschutes National Forest to the Bend Chamber of Commerce. In 1957 some scenes 
  of “&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052034/"&gt;Oregon Passage&lt;/a&gt;” were 
  filmed at the fort. In 1958 the movie “&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052300/"&gt;Tonka&lt;/a&gt;” 
  (later renamed “Comanche”) also used the fort. In 1960 and 1961 the fort was 
  used in a number of episodes of the TV series “&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050025/"&gt;Have 
  Gun Will Travel&lt;/a&gt;”. In 1962 a forest fire burned part of the area surrounding 
  the fort which effected its future use so a few years later the fort was burned 
  and the area was replanted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on my memory of the general location and an old aerial photograph of the fort, I located the fort on map and obtained coordinates. I was able to locate burnt posts and all four corners.  Overall size of the fort was about 200 by 225 feet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is in an ammo can a short distance from the fort’s location. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  To the southeast is Newberry Volcano, which is a massive shield volcano covering 
  some 500 square miles (an oval shaped area about 30 miles north-south and 20 
  miles east-west). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area to the south and southwest is underlain by the Bend basalt. About 
  80,000 years ago this flow from Newberry pushed the Deschutes River westward 
  against Benham Buttes. Much of the flow pasted through Lava River Cave and another 
  branch went north to underlie Bend and extend almost to Redmond. Over the next 
  70,000 years the river cut a new channel along the margin of the flow. Near 
  this point there was a canyon which was about a 100 feet deeper than today&amp;#8217;s 
  channel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the east is Lava Butte and its lava flow. The eruption occurred 7000 years 
  ago and again blocked the Deschutes River. The flow filled the deep canyon of 
  the Deschutes and formed a lake which extended up river beyond the Sunriver 
  area. As the lake rose, the lowest point was a low saddle on Benham Buttes. 
  As the lake overflowed it cut the channel that is now Benham Falls. &lt;a href="http://www.wou.edu/las/physci/taylor/gs407rivers/jen_chit_01.pdf"&gt;For

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">1 and 2 of 6 are spending a week in Sunriver celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary.  We thought the Benham cache series would be a great way to spend some of our time.  We were right.  The weather was perfect for caching (mid-50s with partial sunshine) and there were no mosquitoes to be found anywhere.  Since it is before Memorial Day weekend, crowds were nonexistent and we had practically the whole area to ourselves.  We did the series in order, so this was our second find.  Referencing a topo map before embarking on this one really helped us know what to expect, and the resulting view was incredible.  Since it was in the mid-50s with a wind-chill of about 15 at Waypoint 2, we didn't spend too much time at the waypoint.  We did Fort Benham yesterday, so didn't do the series as a loop all at one time.  That meant some backtracking (heading back to the car instead of directly to Benham Falls), but on a day like today we welcomed the extra time outdoors.    TNLNSL.  TFTF</groundspeak:text>

This place is special because its where our son played checkers which his grandpa and raved about the time he spent with grandpa!  The table here used to have a checker/chess board.  Sadly, that top has been replaced.  There is no parking near this cache, so it is recommended to take your bike or plan a long walk from Fort Rock Park.  From Bike Me #3, just continue on the River Loop.  There is no need to bushwhack.  Bring a scribble stick to sign the log.

NOTE: Path is busier in the summer months. Please use care when removing and replacing this cache. Please replace it as you found it. Thanks</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The starting coordinates will put you in the parking lot at the East Benham Day Use area, which is a Recreation Fee Site so a parking pass is required.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is the sixth in a series of eight earthcaches being developed at major points of interest in Newberry National Volcanic Monument in cooperation with the staff of the Deschutes National Forest. The Benham Falls area is generally accessible by car from early-May to mid-November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To log this cache post your favorite photo along the trail and e-mail me the answers to the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Title of interpretive sign at N 43° 55.954 W 121° 25.006&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given that each plank on the footbridge is 1 foot wide, (a) how long is the bridge and (b) how wide is the river channel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name on sign at N 43° 56.359 W 121° 24.784&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While doing this earthcache you may also be able to collect the necessary information to claim more than a dozen waymarks in the area.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

As Newberry Volcano has grown over the last half million years it has gradually been displacing the Deschutes River westward. Over the last 100,000 years, two eruptions have shaped the Benham Falls area. Prior to 74,000 years ago, the Deschutes River was located somewhere to the east between Benham Buttes and Green Mountain (north of Lava Butte). About 74,000 years ago an eruption on the northwest flank of Newberry produce a large tube-fed basalt flow that moved north and west. Much of the flow pasted through Lava River Cave and another branch went north to underlie Bend and extend almost to Redmond. This large flow destroyed the previous river channel and over time a new channel was established along the western edge of the flow against the edge of Benham Buttes. Over the next 70,000 years the river cut a new channel along the margin of the flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to the eruption of Lava Butte, the Deschutes River occupied a canyon (80 to 100 feet deep) from Bend to a point several miles upstream from Benham Falls. The eruption occurred 7000 years ago and again blocked the Deschutes River. The flow filled the deep canyon of the Deschutes from the Benham Falls area to Dillon Falls area with more than 100 feet of lava and formed a dam resulting in a lake which extended up river beyond the Sunriver area. As the lake rose, the lowest point was a low saddle on Benham Buttes. As the lake overflowed it cut the channel that is now Benham Falls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you stand on the bridge on the trail to Benham Falls, the rim rock you see to the south is the rim of the old river canyon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the geology of the area, there is an interpretive trail dealing with the history and ecology of the area.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;THIS CACHE IS NOT AT THE LISTED COORDINATES!  Please read the description fully before attempting this cache. Congratulations to Skanderson for making it look easy with your FTF!&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Who will study our civilization when we are gone, and what will they make of our culture, our religion and our rituals? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The art in the center of our roundabouts will long outlive the roads and is sure to confuse them a little.  And then there are the weird hoists we built to carry us to the top of some mountains, which most certainly must have been part of some sort of a religious ritual.  And what will they think when they stumble across our geocaches?  Will they be mistaken for some sort of offering to keep the demons at bay, or is that actually what they are for some of us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing is for certain…we are leaving a mark and the evidence is everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find this cache you must find the tip of the inner loop and search for the final cache coordinates there.  Yeah, it's that easy.  I will be a good dog though, and throw a couple of bones your way.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I placed no less than four sets of coordinates at the tip of the loop to make it a little easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6em;"&gt;Second, a hint; if you think you are in the right area but can't find the coordinates, it might just be that you are not listening.  Make yourself as still as possible, and with the right conditions, the answer you seek just might come to you on the wind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy the journey, whether you find it or not.  All of the waypoints are within one half mile of the listed coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">OmNom! really wanted to try this cache in order to fill another portion of a fizzy challenge.  So did some research and determined what type of equipment may be useful.  We drove and parked on the east side of the trail and started the hike.  Crossing the bridge was nice.  We eventually spotted a likely spot to begin our assent to GZ.  After a few hundred feet, the mosquitoes discovered our presence and began their relentless attack.  I even managed to swallow one because of my heavy breathing.  Yuck!   [:(!]  Once we go to GZ, it took some looking.  My gps seemed quite bouncy.  When I finally ID'd the cache, I was grateful that I had brought the correct equipment and was able to make the grab.  That's when the mosquitoes really descended on me in swarms.  We raced to take a picture and re-secure the cache.  Mosquitoes chased us all the way back down the hill.  The name for this cache is appropriate.  Once we got home, I even discovered that my shirt was too thin to offer complete protection.  It will be an uncomfortable night.  Thanks for the adventure.  Favorite point for the effort to place this cache.  Log and cache are in great shape.</groundspeak:text>

FIRST 5/5 CACHE EVER!
So, i have always wanted to get a 5/5 cache, and when i looked for 5/5 caches near sunriver, i found this! When we arrived, there were mosquitoes everywhere! I was getting eaten alive! Then walking up to GZ was another challenge. Mosquitoes while hiking up was hard. I kept complaining but not giving up going uphill which was super steep! When the search started, i was looking everywhere and then dad spotted it. We kind of lucked out because he bought the perfect geotool this morning. Thanks for the 5/5 and for the fun. Earns a fav.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">This cache is located on a high point on the Lava Butte Lava Flow
with a great view of most of the flow. Wear sturdy hard soled
shoes, carry water, and be prepared to walk across sections of the
lava flow. This is NOT a cache for small childern.
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The final cache is in an ammo box. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The best place to begin from is the Benham Falls Day Use area
(N43°55.892’, W121°24.790). A Northwest Forest Pass is required
here, but there are alternative parking areas outside the Day Use
area that do not need a pass. From where ever you decide to park,
your first destination is N43°55.776’, W121°24.586’. You are
looking for a 3”x2”x1/2" metal tin with instructions inside. At
this point you are standing near the point where the old Deschutes
River canyon wall disappers beneath the Lava Butte flow. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
At the second location you will again be located above the old
buried channel of the Deschutes River. The filling of the river
channel resulted in a lake that backed up beyond Sunriver. The
resulting lake rose until if found the lowest outlet point which
happened to be west of here across the older rocks of Benham
Buttes. The third location will put you on the east side of Benham
Falls after passing through last year's burn. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
At the final location you are again at a location high above the
original channel of the river. To the SE there is a great profile
view of Lava Butte. The northeast rim of the butte is highest
because the wind was coming out of the SW. You can also see the
rocky vent area for the flow at the south base of the butte. There
are also views of Mt. Bachelor, Tumalo Mtn, South Sister, Broken
Top and the very tops of Middle Sister and North Sister. To the
north Awbrey Butte and Pilot Butte in Bend are visible. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Also to the north is the kipuka (Hawaiian word for patch of land
surrounded by a lava flow) where the Lava Free Island Cache is
located. If you want to continue on to the Lava Free Island Cache
you will need it's directions and then go to N43°56.550’,
W121°24.469’ ,these coordinates are at the south end of the trail
described in Lava Free Island Cache info. Follow the old trail
north to the kipuka and then follow the cache directions. This
trail was built in 1907 and came from Bend down to a power site
claim at Benham Falls. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
An alternative route to the Lava View Cache is to find the Lava
Free Island Cache first. Then go to N43°56.657’, W121°24.172’ and
follow the old trail south across the lavas to N43°56.550’,
W121°24.469’. Look for a black 3”x2”x1/2’ metal tin hidden in the
back of a 12” diameter hole in the lava at the end of the trail.
Inside the tin are two numbers. aaa=#1-474 and bbb=#2+384 The
coordinates for the third location described above are N43°56.aaa,
W121°24.bbb and the black tin is under a rock at the base of a
blackened pine.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I agree with those previous talking about the swearing at nothing and general frustration. First two waypoints lead us astray towards thinking the next two would be of a similar difficulty. Performed some maintenance on the first waypoint as it was moldy and leaning towards unreadable. This was wholly deserving of the difficulty/terrain given it, and that is why GPS51111 and I were out to get this cache in the first place. Looking back on this cache I have fonder memories than while doing it, the bushwhacking we did was intense. There were bushes that were taller than my head and we had to wade through them in some sort of attempt to make headway. It was slow going but actually finding all the caches was easy, final took a little bit longer but most of them were obvious or the GPS just lead me right to them. The final had some great swag and I traded for a cool screwdriver. Wish we had had a cache to hide for people between the waypoints. This one put us in a good spot to get Bachelor View and was a real adventure...

No trees were killed to send this message, but a large number of electrons were terribly inconvenienced.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well, well, you must like being cursed at because that seems like a running theme to the finders of this one!  We actually thought we could get as many as 18 caches today! That number dwindled to 3 ! After reading the other logs I think the brush wasn't as thick when this was hidden.....I just  can't imagine anyone walking through this , unless you are a satonist. No dogs, no small kids,  well,  just don't even try if you aren't up for adventure. You really need a few hours, long pants,  long sleeves and I needed gloves.  GG told me to wear pants- I didn't listen- and by time we left I had blood all over both legs and part of my hand.  Took a sewing kit and left some pin things. ( I don't know how to describe them). Thanks for the insane day.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was by far the hardest, most challenging cache I have found!  It was quite an adventure!  First two finds no problem, but then bushwacking through the roughest area I have ever been I was cussing out the owner of this cache.  When we finally got to the lone pine the view was amazing so I forgave the owner a little.  Tough, tough hike!</groundspeak:text>

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background:&lt;/strong&gt;  On our annual trip to Sunriver, OmNom! said that he really wanted to do something different.  We’ve gone hiking, horse riding, kayaking, and biking.  “Hey dad,” he said, “let’s play golf.”  Now I am not a good golfer, but I didn’t want to disappoint.  So we gathered our equipment and headed to the tee.  “Hit it hard,” OmNom! encouraged.  I pulled my club back and gave the ball a solid strike.  Only I didn’t see where it went.  OmNom! and I looked for hours, but failed to find the darned ball.  “OmNom!,” I said, “how about we stick to geocaching?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cache:&lt;/strong&gt;  This cache is a log only container, so please bring your own pen.  A geotool will be helpful for log extraction.  The cache is only a few steps off of the bike path.  Please do not travel near any of the properties or the golf course.  This area is a high muggle area, so please rehide the container out of site.  Coordinates were taken with a Garmin 62s.  If you have issues with the coordinates please leave a note and I will update the page.&lt;/p&gt;

I put the kayak in at the top of Dillon falls and paddled upstream caching along the way to Benham Falls and then made the return trip. 4.5 miles and 2.5 hours in all. The light rain came down for part of the morning but otherwise the cool summer morning lacked any wind which made for great paddling. In all I was able to find six of the nine caches along this area most of which had not been found in over 18 months. TFTH!</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;The four Benham Caches (Fort Benham, Benham View, Benham Falls, and Benham Bonus) are located on the Benham Buttes which are a group of 1.8 million year old rhyodacite domes. Access to the area is from the road to West Benham Falls trailhead. There are some roads into the area but the area is posted as no motorized vehicles so please respect the closure. Many of the roads are overgrown but still make great hiking or biking trails. The first three caches can be done individually or all at the same time as part of a 5 mile loop. To do the Benham Bonus cache you must do the other three first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the eruption Lava Butte (7000 years ago) the old channel of the river had been filled to the east of Benham Buttes. With the river blocked a lake formed which extended up river beyond the Sunriver area. As the lake rose, the lowest point was a low saddle on Benham Buttes. As the lake overflowed it cut the channel that is now Benham Falls. &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wou.edu/las/physci/taylor/gs407rivers/jen_chit_01.pdf"&gt;For more details on the geology check here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Good Day,

It looks like your cache has been under the weather for some time. While I feel that Geocaching.com should hold the location for you and block other cachers from entering the area around this cache for a reasonable amount of time, we can't do so forever. Please either repair/replace this cache in the next couple of weeks, or archive it so that someone else can place a cache in the area, and cachers can once again enjoy visiting this location.

If the reason the cache is under the weather is something out of your control, such as construction or flooding, please post a note on the cache page with your best guess of when the conditions will improve. If the situation is temporary and is something out of your control, there is no need to archive the cache at this time. Please however, add a note to the cache page detailing the situation to allow others to understand the situation - and - to prevent this from being archived for inactivity.

I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to geocaching in the past and am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the future.

Thanks for your understanding - Cheers!

NOTE: My preferred method of communication is through notes on the cache page in question. However, should you wish to use email - please do not select "reply". In general, a replay to the geocaching.com mail bot will not reach me. Instead, please go to your cache page and e-mail GeoCrater from the log there or email me directly at geocrater@gmail.com, referencing the cache URL, or waypoint number.

Additional translation added as I support a number of countries:

Buenos días,

Parece que tu caché ha estado desatendido durante una temporada. Aunque geocaching.com debe guardar esa ubicación para tí, y bloquearla a otros cachers durante un periodo de tiempo razonable, no podemos continuar haciéndolo indefinidamente. Por favor, repara o reemplaza este caché durante las próximas dos semanas, o archívalo para que algún otro pueda colocar un caché en esa zona y los cachers puedan disfrutar de nuevo visitándola.

Si el motivo de que el caché no haya sido atendido es algo que se escapa a tu control, como unas obras o inundaciones, por favor, publica una nota en la página del caché con una estimación de cuándo mejorarán esas condiciones. Si la situación es temporal y es algo fuera de tu control, no hace falta archivar el caché por este motivo. Sin embargo, por favor, añade una nota a la página del caché, detallando la situación para que otros comprendan lo que ocurre y para evitar el archivo por inactividad.

De todas formas, quiero agradecerte tu contribución al geocaching y espero ver tu caché en marcha y funcionando próximamente.

Gracias por tu comprensión.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I was surprised that there really was a blind here but the contents within show it's used occasionally. I put the kayak in at the top of Dillon falls and paddled upstream caching along the way to Benham Falls and then made the return trip. 4.5 miles and 2.5 hours in all. The light rain came down for part of the morning but otherwise the cool summer morning lacked any wind which made for great paddling. In all I was able to find six of the nine caches along this area most of which had not been found in over 18 months. TFTH!</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">The highway Elk Jim mentions is closed, due to the 4-5 ft waterlevel drop.  Sam the Cat and KR beached the Dagger at the muddy outlet and considered dragging the trusty red Dagger over the mud flats to some possible floatation on fall waters....but NO...!!...there would be no float on this approach to the Duck Blind during the low fall waters.  

We elected to hoof in the 4 inch mud alongside the outlet stream, following tracks of raccoon, beaver, heron, skunks, and others.  Eventually reached the structure and claimed the find.  This mud is lurking for those who tread upon her surface.  

Voted the series as a favorite but still are looking for River Run 1, since the series starts at RR#2.  Made our way back downstream to Dillon take-out in 40 minutes and exited in the Rooster at 4:30 pm, as the air was becoming humid with the drop in temperatures.  Bailey and BC</groundspeak:text>

Nice little workout, plus today we had the opportunity to pick up all nine Bad Dogs River Run Caches. But what a day to pick, the river was as high as I have ever seen it, however, it was a very nice day on the water with Jean, sun, wind, caches and lunch on the water at the Duck Blind. Thanks so much for all the great fun TFTF!

LOL we made this one way too hard.  When we figured it out we had a good laugh...</groundspeak:text>

We love walking and biking along the 30+ miles of pathways throughout the Sunriver resort area. We hope you enjoy the area as much as we do.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache takes you down to the River Loop which is a route we love to ride.  There is no parking near this cache, so it is recommended to take your bike or plan a long walk from Fort Rock Park.  From Bike Me #2, you want to head to Circle 4, then towards Circle 5 to find the River Loop.  For this cache, you are looking for a bison tube.  There is no need to bushwhack.  Bring a scribble stick to sign the log.

NOTE: Path is busier in the summer months. Please use care when removing and replacing this cache. Please replace it as you found it. Thanks</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache is hidden inside the Lava Butte lava flow with a nice view of Mt. Bachelor.  "Fee-free parking" coordinates are N 43 55.721 W 121 24.516.  Once you near your North/South coordinate, you should be able to see a short crossing to lava free ground.  (If approaching from the railroad tracks.)  Find the safest way across the lava.   (Lava flows can be ankle turners so wear sturdy shoes or boots.) The cache is in a GREEN AMMO BOX. Some climbing is required to get the cache, but if you survey the area, you can find a safe route. After finding the cache, find higher ground for a full view of the Cascades. This is not a good cache for children.&lt;p&gt;The original cache includes:&lt;br&gt;1. Boxing push-up toy.&lt;br&gt;2. Rubber chicken keychain.&lt;br&gt;3. Green frog.&lt;br&gt;4. Finger puppet.&lt;br&gt;5. Atomic Boy CD.&lt;br&gt;6.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We had just been at Lava View Cache and it put GPS51111 and I in a good place to head over to this cache. Got one FTF and a two caches in the lava, wish we had had more time but we were getting tired and it was the right choice to turn back. Found the cache quickly upon arrival and had our water break here. It was a good day of caching, a long day of caching but a good one. Tried to stay mostly off the lava on our way back, saw the train going through the field, luckily we weren’t on the tracks at the time.

No trees were killed to send this message, but a large number of electrons were terribly inconvenienced.

----------------------------------
Spam
(Noun) A brand of several canned precooked meat products made by the Hormel Foods Corporation. It was first introduced in 1937 and gained popularity worldwide after its use during World War II. The labeled ingredients in the classic variety of Spam are chopped pork shoulder meat, with ham meat added, salt, water, modified potato starch as a binder, sugar, and sodium nitrite as a preservative. Spam's gelatinous glaze forms from the cooling of meat stock.



Spamming
(Verb) The act of obnoxiously doing something repeatedly for attention or in order to disturb others.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This is a little more challenging, multi-stage geocache that starts in Sunriver.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This multi-stage cache starts in Sunriver. You cannot park on any of the streets of Sunriver. Legal parking is at N 43 degrees  53.443', W 121 degrees 25.703'. This is a walking or mountain biking geocache with a total distance travelled of about 6 or 7 kilometers (including the trip back to the start). Do not attempt to drive from one stage to the next.&lt;p&gt;It will help to have a map of the Sunriver bike paths. Free maps are often available at kiosks located along several roads in Sunriver. Note that most of these maps have west at the top, instead of the usual north.&lt;p&gt;It will help to understand latitude and longitude as you do this geocache.&lt;p&gt;The first stages of this geocache are luggage tags located about 1.5 meters high on trees. The geocache itself is a green ammo can on the ground.&lt;p&gt;There are no special hazzards involved here, except that the geocache is located fairly close to a barbed-wire fence. Note that you do not need to cross this fence to reach the cache.

Additional Waypoints
</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>In this area, latitude increases when you go north and longitude increases when you go west. The geocache is 3 meter south of the barbed-wire fence.

Actually I might have said that out loud, but since nobody was around, it didn't make a sound.  I paused for a while on the rock overlooking the blue lagoon and thought, "cool place to meditate!"  Then I waded through some rough manz and thought, "this isn't cool."  Everything was cool again when I got to the cache "hey, I can see Homer's Home from here."

A fantastic hide...Thanks.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">It never ceases to amaze us as to what we may find when out caching. We love this activity as it always takes us to places we would not have seen otherwise. This is one of those places. It is a memorial park in the middle of the timber. Tried to find some more information about the park online without success.

The cache is a "drive up" if you find the right road and is slightly larger than a 35mm canister. Bring your own writing stick.</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Out solo today for some more adventurous caching.  I worked my way out from the Benham Falls South parking lot and grabbed the four closest caches along Benham Road on the way back out.  I didn't have my bike, so I drove along Benham Road and stopped at each to dash in, bushwacking to grab each cache.  I also needed a few Bad Dogs caches as I'm very close to being able to complete a 100 by one cache challenge, where I need to have found 100 caches put out by one cacher.  I'm within 10 of having 100 Bad Dogs caches.  These 3 caches fit the bill nicely on the way out.  

This is clearly not a Bad Dogs cache, but I couldn't leave it undiscovered.  I was saddened to see the sign has been vandalized repeatedly over the years with gun shots.  The posts are also rotted and the sign now rests on a nearby tree.  From the Bubblegummers comments I wonder if there is anyone left to care anymore that it had become dilapidated.  I found the cache easily enough and took the travel bug to move along.  Thanks for the Smiley!!

Left a very small TB.  Doesn't look like one.  It's a star, so whoever finds it, please move it along. 

Interesting area.  Didn't see any grave markers.  Will definitely have to find out more about this from the Deschutes historical society if there be one.

Upgraded it into a multi. Have a nice walk in the meadow. First point is in a water proof match container. The coordinates lead to the final in an old camp spot that needs some tlc.

* The final cords are written on the outside of the pen on the wood cross beam at the same hint spot with a black sharpie.*

Someone does not like my cache out here or it might be just fine.

The written cords can't be lost or moved

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We had visited that corral several years ago, when there was a different cache nearby.  The mosquitoes were awful on the recent visit so we elected to come back today for the find.  Problem was we approached from the shortest distance from the old cinder road and got caught up in all the blow-down timber.  A better approach is to go down this road from south of the cache and head overland at 020 true when 0.3 from the cache.  That route will take you through an open pondo forest with few obstacles to deal with.  Mosquitoes were still an issue today.  

That sure was an old camp area at the final.  There is a thinning operation nearby but the cache is safe.  BaileyBellaBC</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;This is a geocache that can be obtained by walking, biking, or driving a 2,000 pound steel box: Your choice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While here you can watch the kayakers, rafters, paddle boarders, etc. float by.  This is also a good spot for viewing some of the wildlife on the river. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should be an easy cache to find. There's not much around GZ. Absolutely no bushwacking required. You could almost grab it from your car. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is definitely a Park &amp;amp; Grab. &lt;/p&gt;

Good parking.  Icy in winter but flat walking.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">While in Sun River you will definately want to go to this area for having some fun.  
Canoe or raft or one of those fun roundies to float down the river.  You can rent all of them here. 

There is also a great place to eat that is very close to the cache area.  The lunches are super!

A short walk to the cache location.  Don't have to move anything.  Poke around and bring it out.  

Small tube container that can hold small items.  Log book. 
Please bring your own pen or pencil.

At night you can hear the puppies howling and the owls screaching right above your head. 
Bring a flashlight as it is very dark right where the cache is. 
***Yes Yes---I know the coords are off a bit.  It was 10:00 at night---those dang dogs were howling and sneeking up on us and the owls were screeching like crazy--it's scary out there at night.
So look at the hint and do as it says.</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Look for Mary McCallum!  It is close by but not exactly as the coords indicate!  Looking at the gate------- to the right side, several feet back from the gate.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Short ways off the bike/ped path is another Sunriver bench.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Could park at the Nature Center and have a leisurely stroll to this cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I've often passed this spot on my bike and today decided to stop and enjoy the view.  Peaceful.  With a little bit of luck you may see the Swan whom I've seen here a few times in the past month.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Enjoy the view and take a stroll down the short path to the water. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rated as 1.5 because the bench is not easily accessible by wheel chair.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;BRING A SCRIBBLE STICK. BYOP CACHE IS NOW A NANO&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;While hiking, walking, biking, or taking a leisurely drive in a 2000 pound steel box, this cache can be accessed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is parking near the Marina and Hola Restaurant after which a short stroll will take you to the cache location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing geographically or historically significant about this cache location.  Sorry about that.  However, there are nice vistas from this cache location.  What am I talking about.  There are nice vistas from almost anywhere in Sunriver!!!  If you arrive around sunset you may have horses as watch guards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy this one.  &lt;/p&gt;
For the FTF there is a small compass in the cache.

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Best way to this cache is via bicycle but you can also drive to the Nature Center/Observatory parking lot.  There is a cache near the parking lot and this cache is a short hike.  If using car and parking at the Nature Center, go down the path and turn right under the roadway. About 1/2 mile walk to the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a 35 mm film cannister sized container.  Only room for a log. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="5"&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;BRING A SCRIBBLE STICK&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;From this location you have an expansive view of the meadow and you're not too far from the Marina. Good location for watching the private planes land and take off. Also, sometime in the evening they run the horses by here. Check with stable for approx time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="6"&gt;PLEASE PLACE CACHE AS FOUND AND NOT IN PLAIN SIGHT&lt;br /&gt;
SO THE CACHE CAN'T BE SEEN BY MUGGLES.&lt;br /&gt;

In 1996 we were sitting at Mcmenamins discussing a name for our new Yorkie. As we were enjoying our favorite beer Rubinator (Ruby and Terminator mixed), we immediately decided on the name Ruby. Sunriver was her favorite place to visit. On September 1st, 2012, after a week long family vacation, she passed away at our house and not too far from this cache location.

This can be found by car, but best by bike due to parking. However, you can park on the side street.  It is not located on a bike path.

The light rain came down for part of the morning but otherwise the cool summer morning lacked any wind which made for great paddling. In all I was able to find six of the nine caches along this area most of which had not been found in over 18 months. TFTH!</groundspeak:text>

Put-in at Dillon Falls boat launch and quickly made our crossing in the strong current to the east bank, least we succumb to the FALLS.  The water level was down some 4 feet with the Benham rate meter at 660 cfs.  

Loved this autumn adventure and even saw a river otter, evidence of at least hundreds/thousands of beaver on the east bank.  Beavers like solitude and the east bank is backed by HUGE lava fields.  Think again if you want to do this series via land from the RR tracks to the east rather than by water craft.  We completed the RT of 4.75 miles in 3.5 hrs from the 1 pm put-in.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">I will make no illusions about this cache, it is hard, it is supposed to be hard. It is small, it is camouflaged and it is an adventure.&lt;br /&gt;
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Once I lived a life not knowing there were caches on the lava flow but then my eyes were opened to the torture that these caches are and far be it from me to stop the cycle of hurting, instead I choose to embrace it and make your pain my pleasure &lt;img alt height="15" src="/images/icons/icon_smile_evil.gif" title width="15" /&gt; this cache is however an honest challenge and not just a needle in a stack of lava rock. I have never enjoyed that sort of a challenge as it is just as easily accomplished by randomly walking up to the exact right spot or moving the right rock, it doesn't leave a feeling of satisfaction in the mouth. This should hopefully be more an adventure. For those who do not carry certain supplies with them I would suggest reading the hint as without it you may be ill prepared &lt;img src="http://www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile_dead.gif" border="0" align="middle" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="UserSuppliedContent" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;font-family:Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, sans-serif;vertical-align:baseline;color:rgb(89, 74, 66);line-height:18px;"&gt;&lt;span style="margin:0px;padding:0px;font-style:inherit;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;"&gt;This is an especially low muggle area with nothing anywhere so be as loud and obvious as you wish, no one is gonna find this by accident! As always cache in, trash out (yes there is trash out on the lava flow... humans are amazing like that). Be safe, don't do anything you don't feel comfortable with and good luck, I really mean this with this cache because it will not be easy and lava rock can shift or break easily under anyone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
P.S. I would love feedback on the helpfulness of hints and the accuracy of ratings or anything that you could think of that would improve the experience for those after you, except of course for taking it down because it is too hard &lt;img src="http://www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile_tongue.gif" border="0" align="middle" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>A flashlight or light source of some kind is necessary for this cache but I didn't want to include it in the attributes because I thought it would give away too much too soon but if you're looking at the hint this should help.

P.S. If you are out there and don't want to log a DNF call me at (541) 848-7647 and I'll be sure and point you in the right direction (also cause I'll want to meet you and shake your hand [:P])</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

It was a surreal day of caching on the flow with a muted sun shining through the cloud cover, whipping winds and snow that came in from all directions.  I love the loneliness of this place and I appreciate the challenge.  I didn't have much left in the tank after this one, so I limped back to my truck with my crooked grin and called it a day.

This was the first stop for a cache I hadn't done on our hike of 9.67 miles over 10 long hours. Spent way to much time looking for this DNF but because it is a micro/small hidden in the lava the D/T rating is accurate. Don't plan on making a second trip as we looked every place based on the information we were provided by the CO. Awful lot of time and effort for a DNF. Happy Caching.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is hidden in a Lava Free Island in the middle of the Lava Butte lava flow. If you can find it, there is a funky road that has been hammered into the lava that leads to the Island. The coordinates for the beginning of the lava road are N 43 56.953' W 121 22.933'. Once you find the beginning of the road, follow it through the flow to the Lava Free Island. The road is relatively easy to spot, but can be an ankle turner. Wear sturdy shoes and be ready to steady each other! Once you get to the Island take some time and explore to the west. It's pretty cool! The cache is a green ammo can. You will have to do some scrambling to find it. This is probably not the best cache for children under the age of 9 or 10. </groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p style="margin:0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;font:10.0px Geneva;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing:0.0px;"&gt;For the last eight years I’ve been volunteering with the U.S. Geological Survey during the summer as a field assistant to help with the geologic mapping of Newberry Volcano. Over the last few months I’ve been exploring the relationship between the Deschutes River and the western margin of the “basalt of Bend” from Tumalo to Sunriver.  As a final need in that project, I had to explore the area along the western edge of the Lava Butte flow. Since I was going to be out here I decided to drop a series of caches. All caches are in small plastic storage containers (about 8”x4”x4”) and all are located on the Lava Butte flow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;font:10.0px Geneva;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing:0.0px;"&gt;This cache is located on an island of pahoehoe lava surrounded by aa lava.  Both flow types are part of the Lava Butte flow. The cache is about half way between Dillon Falls and the large kipuka near the railroad.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;font:10.0px Geneva;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing:0.0px;"&gt;Due to the remote location no attempt was made to hide the cache other than placing it in a sheltered location.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">(FTF) at 2:48pm another fun one, the approach for this one was much easier. I perhaps made the mistake and brought a friend and he seemed none too happy about it so I may have to stop here for today. I'll certainly be back to finish up the series though. 

I forgot to mention how much I loved this little oasis in the middle of the flow, there were some really cool cracks and it exists as a wonderfully calming area in the wake of so much ancient destruction. I also had a chance on this journey out to hide my own cache on the lava field.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This is the second of the Bike Me series in Sunriver and is a multicache. Sunriver is one of our favorite places to spend time. We love walking and biking along the 30+ miles of pathways throughout the Sunriver resort area. We hope you enjoy the area as much as we do.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This was our son's idea to do a multi-cache.  This is a two-stage multi and allows you to maybe head a direction you haven't been on the path before.  The first waypoint is not far from Sunriver Bike Me #1 and will contain the coordinates of the final destination.  At the first waypoint, you are looking for the final coordinates written in a hidden location, the final is a rx container with a log.  This will be a little more difficult than #1 in the series.  The final is about 5' off the path, please respect the natural areas by being careful where you step. There is no parking on the roads in Sunriver, please obey these rules. The best place to park is near the Sunriver Village and bike or walk from there. As we add to this series, biking will be a great way to see the area. Bring a scribble stick to log your find. 

NOTE: Path is busier in the summer months. Please  use care when removing and replacing the waypoint and the final for this cache. Please replace them as you found them. Thanks

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;We decided to add a new style to the Bike Me series.  Molly, our Caching Canine, in training, came along on her evening walk to place this hide. The cache can be reached from the paved bike path. You will be looking for a zip-lock pill bag that is in a tight spot.  This is a log only cache. Check between 3 and 5 feet above ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you enjoy this hide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type hide may be more commonly found in an urban setting. We are adding some help for those new to caching, so you can be better equipped for urban caches later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many new cachers that visit Sunriver to start or continue caching. This type of hide and cache container may be new to newbies. Check the sign panels. They bend slightly and may conceal a slim log-only cache container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raised the difficulty rating on 7/26/15.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">!!!!!!! HAPPY NEW YEAR - 2010 !!!!!! 

(The original owner moved; the cache was muggled; and no maintenance followed.) 

We decided to bring this nice multi-cache back to life. The search can be done by a bike ride or a comfortable walk. Check out this nice area with great views and surroundings. Look for Mt Bachelor, Paulina Peak, the Deschutes River, and the Great Meadow. A 50 cal. ammo can is at the final location. Please re-hide with camo cover to avoid muggling. Have a safe hunt. 

The new cache is stocked with: 
A bracelet 
An XL t-shirt "EAT SLEEP CACHE" 
Several travelers 
A $1.00 for FTF 

July 25, 2011 UPDATE: The coordinates for WP#2 disappeared when the map was replaced. That is progress. The coordinates have been replaced for your benefit. Happy Caching!

Over the last few months I’ve been exploring the relationship between the Deschutes River and the western margin of the “basalt of Bend” from Tumalo to Sunriver.  As a final need in that project, I had to explore the area along the western edge of the Lava Butte flow. Since I was going to be out here I decided to drop a series of caches. All caches are in small plastic storage containers (about 8”x4”x4”) and all are located on the Lava Butte flow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;font:10.0px Geneva;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing:0.0px;"&gt;This cache is located near a great view of Dillon Falls from the east side of the river. Here a lobe of the Lava Butte spilled into the old Deschutes River canyon and upstream filled the canyon all the way to the footbridge above Benham Falls. The river now flows along the western margin of the Lava Butte flow and spills back into the old canyon here at Dillon Falls.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;font:10.0px Geneva;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing:0.0px;"&gt;Even though this location is difficult to reach their is evidence that the location is visited so this cache has a couple of rocks hiding it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

This was the third stop for a cache I hadn't done on our hike of 9.67 miles over 10 long hours. Made the find after some looking and a nice hide. Actually parked and started our hike from the end of Osage Rd. but after hiking over to this one decided to do the other two instead of hiking back the way we came. A real challenge getting back to civilization from this area of the lava flow. TFTH. TNLNSL</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">In from WV this week and Bubblegummers took me for a caching hike I'll never forget.  9.8 mile hike today starting at end of Osage Rd and gathering all of the lava flow series.  My feet are aching, had to stop at the Deschutes and grab some water just after grabbing this cache....I ran out.  We saw lots of elk sign in the pines on the Deschutes side of the flow.  I'm done with walking the lava though. That is some tough walking. TFTC</groundspeak:text>

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Sunriver Bike Me Series, by members of our family, are popular.&lt;br /&gt;
We tried to fill in a cache between Sunriver Bike Me #1 &amp;amp; Sunriver Bike Me #2 but the Geocaching guidelines were strictly adherred to &amp;amp; we lost that opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is located to the Right of Sunriver Bike Me # 1, if headed from the Village. It also is about halfway between #1 &amp;amp; #2.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you want to park, park either in SHARC lot or Village lot. There is no parking along the roadways in Sunriver.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The SHARC is the wonderful facility that was recently completed in Sunriver. It attracts many fols this summer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While in Sunriver, respect the environment and enjoy the fresh air and scenery. Enjoy yourself while in this beautiful area.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wheel chair accessible. Please replace cache as you found it. Congratulations to sunriverfab4 for FTF!!

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;"&gt;A simplified example illustrates the nature of this puzzle.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; In this example, you are looking for a mystery 3-digit number.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; You are given Roman numerals for &lt;b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal;"&gt;each digit&lt;/b&gt; of the number in &lt;span class="GramE"&gt;order,&lt;/span&gt; however there is no spacing between the digits:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:&amp;quot;Lucida Console&amp;quot;;"&gt;IIIVII&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;"&gt;You must figure out where the spaces go.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; A possible solution would be to put the spaces as follows, which would result in a number of 352:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:&amp;quot;Lucida Console&amp;quot;;"&gt;III V II&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt; (352)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;"&gt;But there are other possible solutions, depending on where you put the spaces:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:&amp;quot;Lucida Console&amp;quot;;"&gt;II IV II&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt; (242)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:&amp;quot;Lucida Console&amp;quot;;"&gt;III VI I&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt; (361)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:&amp;quot;Lucida Console&amp;quot;;"&gt;II I VII&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt; (217)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:&amp;quot;Lucida Console&amp;quot;;"&gt;I II VII&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt; (127)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;"&gt;Now suppose a clue is provided:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“The second digit of the 3-digit number is larger than the sum of the other two digits.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;"&gt;Clearly, only one of the above solutions fits the clue: the mystery number in this example is 361.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;"&gt;To find the cache, you must decipher its coordinates.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Roman numerals for each of the 15 digits of the coordinate set are given below in order, but there are no spaces between the digits or the two coordinates.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; You must separate the digits.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; The North coordinate is listed first, followed by the West coordinate:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:20.0pt;font-family:&amp;quot;Lucida Console&amp;quot;;"&gt;IVIIIVVIIVIIIVIIIIIIIIIVVIVIIIVI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;"&gt;Here are some clues:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
1.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; The cache is located within a one-mile radius of the listed coordinates at the top of the page.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
2.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; There are no zeroes in the coordinates.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
3.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; The sum of every other digit, starting with the 2nd, is 32.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; In other words, the sum of the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, and 14th digits is 32.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;"&gt;This shouldn’t be as hard as it may look.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; With a little thought and logic, you can eliminate many of the possibilities quickly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;"&gt;There should be only one solution that fits all of the clues above.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; But just in case there is a duplicate solution, you can verify your coordinates with &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;GeoChecker&lt;/span&gt; before heading out to the cache.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; (Please email me if you do find a duplicate!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Snow was not an issue, but the cold temperature caused the object hiding the cache to be frozen in place.  It took a bit of tugging to dislodge it.  All is well!  T4TC.</groundspeak:text>

Thanks to Lost-A-Pair for the help and company planting this cache. Don't forget to visit their Not Lava Free (GC10MRV) and Wired In The Flow (GC10MQW) caches along this same trail. The Lava Free Island cache (GC47DO) is in the Kipuka.

We love walking and biking along the 30+ miles of pathways throughout the Sunriver resort area.  We hope you enjoy the area as much as we do.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is an easy to find nano cache along the biking/walking path in Sunriver. You will not need to leave the path. Please respect the natural areas by not trodding off the path anywhere in Sunriver.  There is no parking on the roads in Sunriver, please obey these rules. The best place to park is near the Sunriver Village, the walk is less than 1/2 mile and biking will be much quicker.  As we add to this series, biking will be a great way to see the area.  Bring a scribble stick to log your find.

NOTE:  Path is busier in the summer months.  Please use care when removing and replacing this cache.  Please replace it as you found it. Thanks

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">We are placing this, our first family cache, in honor of our beloved dog Tucker who passed away recently. Tucker, who we often referred to as “Tuck-man”, loved coming up to Sunriver. He especially loved going on long walks on the bike trails, swimming in the Deschutes River, and chasing tennis balls in the area around this spot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is located near the end of a Sunriver bike trail so would make for an easy walk or bike ride off from the main biking arteries around Sunriver.&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The cache is hidden near a steep uphill section of the deschutes river trail.  Well, uphill if you are headed South along the river, downhill if you are headed North.  We were headed South so that uphill section was responsible for Kristin's leg cramps cramps!

The cache is a little camo tupperware container with logbook and pencil and a few random goodies as well as a travelbug to get it started.  To get to this cache you will have to hike or bike a fair amount.  You can combine this cache with a few others in the area for a good day of hiking and caching.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Third installment of the annual tradition. Sydney and I started this tradition in 2009, sadly, she is no longer with me. So....., it's up to Biskit and myself to carry on with the Super Bowl Sunday hides.

Since I anticipated consuming large quantities of food and beer during the game, we headed out for a walk to place this cache. From Osage, logged just shy of 5 miles R/T. Of course, if you have a severe disregard for your vehicles finish, you can come from Hwy. 97 and run it through the "manzanita car wash". You will then still have the task of dragging your carcass through the remaining manzi.

Short hike into the lava, nice mountain view awaits. As clear as it was today, I could see from Bachelor to Hood.

Here I am heading after GC12, 16, 17, 92 and original Stash from the Bend, OR area in one day.  Left 6am and arrived back in bend about 10pm.  GREAT ADVENTURE!!!

Made a call but he found it over a year ago and couldnt guide me as well as he liked. Finally turned over the right rock. Getting dark so I gotta get out of here. TFTC and tough lava walk.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well, the Mrs. had other plans for the day so I thought I would punish myself and do the four caches out in the lava fields that we hadn't gotten to. They were LavaFlowAGoGo http://coord.info/GC2ANK8, Hawaiian Oasis Hideout http://coord.info/GC2TPG4, Putter's Happy Place http://coord.info/GC3EKNJ and Sydney's Super Bowl Stash 2011 http://coord.info/GC2NERZ. Ended up hiking about 9 miles in 7.75 hours with total ascent on the two hikes of about 1050 ft. I figure about half of the miles were over lava which made for a long day. 

This was the last one of the day. I hadn't paid attention to the location as I thought it was just off the Osage Rd. trail. Silly me as when I was about .4 away I realized I needed to get to the other side of the tracks and it was starting to drizzle. I had come this far and wasn't about to turn tail and head for the geomobile. Lots of navigating for one so close to the edge of the lava field. More work than I planned after doing the other 3 caches. Took some looking, but finally made the find. My "dogs" were really tired by the time I got back to the geomobile. [:D]TFTH.

Different hike/bike length options exist, depending upon trailhead choice.  Other views,vistas, recreation available from both parking areas.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Different approaches may be made to the standard cache from two or more areas, via the Blackrock Trail.
Parking is available with a Northwest Forest Pass at the following two locations:  1. N43:54.537' W121:21.382' and 
2.  N43:55.861'  W121:24.792' (Paved roads take you to parking areas.)  Shorter hike is from parking area #1.
Although the cache is within the Newberry National Volcanic Monument, there is no lava scrambling necessary. (However, lava is everywhere, and not to be ignored!)
Experienced mountain bikers will find this "easy and fun"..intermediate bikers can also do it with a couple of dismounts.
Clear weather will provide views of numerous peaks of the Central Cascades. 
The contents of the cache are in an ammo box and include a variety of items. Altitude of the cache is 4427 ft.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Between the booming thunder behind me and the sound of woodpeckers pecking I had quite the cacophonous entrance, it is magical out here. I love coming out to the lava fields, especially to cache and today was beyond my expectations as far as beautiful and magnificence was concerned. When I started to walk through the burned out forest and I could hear several flickers working away at trees and the background song of a chickadee with occasional booms of wonderfully ominous thunder. It was a special time to be out here, found this cache before the rain started.

No trees were killed to send this message, but a large number of electrons were terribly inconvenienced.

&lt;p&gt;Park at the nearby Sunriver Resort parking area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This area was the South Pool owned by the Sunriver owners.  A land swap resulted in the Sunriver Resort taking over this area in about 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grounds were totally redone and various events are held on the expansive lawn in front of you.  From here you can also see two beautiful Bocci Courts for use by guests staying at the Sunriver Resort.  The Bocci Courts are private.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;b&gt;PARK IN DESIGNATED AREAS ONLY!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is a holdover from the Sunriver OktoberCache event held October 7, 2006. We wanted to give the opportunity for cachers who couldn't make it to our event to nab a few of the caches we had. It also allows those who attended to include it in their cache count.

JUNE 26, 2010: CAUTION!! A cacher recently spotted a cougar in the area, which was hanging around the rock formation where the cache is hidden (no, the cave where the cache is is not big enough to house a big cat, just an ammo can). We do have regular cougar sightings in the Sunriver area. Likely the cat was just "hanging out" or looking for fawns to hunt</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Another cool lava flow. Nice manzanita forest growing on the drive in. Keep your eyes open for mulies and elk.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well I redeemed myself today. I tried this one about 3 years ago and with my youngest daughter and we ran into a cougar. It wasn't hostile but I wasn't expecting to run into one, maybe a deer or a chipmunk. Having my daughter there made me the most worried at the time. Nonetheless we turned back and our nerves were a bit frazzled. Never did tell the wife. Still haven't and still won't. 
However time has passed and it was time to give this one another shot. Jumped on my mountain bike this morning and made the solo ride out here. It was enjoyable and I actually didn't see any wildlife this time except a few birds. Felt good to get this cache a smilie. 8 miles in all as I also got the cache up the way. A good way to start this morning. TFTH!</groundspeak:text>

The rain hit suddenly and hardly let up while I was walking back, skirted the perimeter of this little section of green in the lava to get out.

2. Take a book only if you leave one as well. Each is in a separate ziploc. Don't take the bags; just put the one you're leaving in the same bag as the one you took.
3. Once you take a book, keep it. No need to return anything. 
4. If you take/leave, please say in the log book and in your log below what you took and what you left. I will be using the logs to update the list of available books so people can see what's currently out there.
5. If you could care less about the books and just want your smiley, you are of course welcome. 

Now, I suppose you might want some directions. The best place to park is at Aspen Camp. This area gets a bit congested during rafting season, but that'll all disappear as soon as you hit the trail. I found approaches from below and from above to be equally difficult, so pick your poison. Or try one of each so you can hike a small loop. Reception in the trees could- no, WILL- be iffy, so make the usual changes to your strategy. The north numbers ranged from .071 to .084 while I was there; the west numbers varied less. In addition to the hint below, let me throw you a bone: you're in the ballpark if you find yourself directly downhill from a large, dead deciduous tree. Expect a physically and perhaps mentally challenging search, but you should have enough here to get you zeroed in.

So put down that backpack full of books you brought, roll up your sleeves, and get searching! Those paperbacks aren't gonna read themselves!

Read the description (past the rules and regs of the library) and pay attention to the last "bone" for info.  The deciduous tree is actually a bunch of small trunks.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">When I was very young, my parents bought one of the first places available in SunRiver. As fate would have it, I was "forced" to spend my childhood summers there. At that time it was mostly un-developed, except for a great swimming pool, lots of tennis courts, the golf course, bike paths, and the "Establishment". We spent many many hours very close to the final cache location cooling off in the summer heat.
&lt;p&gt;The final coords can be located at:&lt;/p&gt;

There is no roadside parking in Sunriver, so if arriving by car, follow Meadow Road to the SW corner of Sunriver.  Turn right off Meadow Road at N 43° 51.863, W 121° 27.093, which is a dirt/gravel round-about with limited parking.  Approximately 60 feet west of the parking coordinates, a short dirt path leads to the paved bike path.  Go towards the river.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The cache is a 20-25 minute walk along one of the most beautiful scenic river views in Sunriver.  Take time to read the interpretive signs, enjoy the wildlife and views, or rest at one of the many park benches along the route.

Be on the lookout for muggles, especially during summer months.  Re-hide well.

Cache is a camouflaged 58-ounce plastic container.  Checked and restocked August 16, 2013.</groundspeak:long_description>

The smell was magnificent, though I can't say I could fully enjoy it as I was mostly thinking about how slippery the rocks under my feet were about to become. Cache is still fairly out in the open and not in good shape. I only had time to sign and run because it had already started raining on my approach. A wonderful experience all round [:D]

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Heard the song of a chickadee while I was looking. It was right where I would expect it and this was a nice stop on my day of grabbing a few caches and getting rained on. I parked right by the cache and had to take refuse in my car at least once from the rain that threatened to soak me. It was a wonderful spring shower though and it was clear that it was just one or two clouds passing over me and being sure to rain just on me [:D]

No trees were killed to send this message, but a large number of electrons were terribly inconvenienced.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;In Sunriver, there are over 35 miles of MUPs(Multiple Use Paths) which allow wonderful views from a myriad of locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can hike or bike to this location but biking is probably the easiest way to get here.  Or you could be playing a round of golf and hit one way out of bounds and tell your golf partners you're going to look for your ball when you really want to find a geocache.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sit a spell and enjoy the pastoral view with Mt. Bachelor in the background.  In the months of May and June the mountain is dazzling draped in the last remnants of a white winter.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should be an easy peasy find but it is a nano so that might provide a bit of a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

found the right spur into this one and dodged a few rocks weaving my way close by. didn't realize that there was such a system of foot trails in the area.  nobody around until i was on my way out when i met a small pickup loaded with young boys who were headed to the woods to get high or murder someone. who knows i got the hell out of there!!!</groundspeak:text>

All involve varying amounts of travel across rough lava depending on the route taken, choose your route carefully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p style="margin:0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;font:10.0px Geneva;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing:0.0px;"&gt;For the last eight years I’ve been volunteering with the U.S. Geological Survey during the summer as a field assistant to help with the geologic mapping of Newberry Volcano. Over the last few months I’ve been exploring the relationship between the Deschutes River and the western margin of the “basalt of Bend” from Tumalo to Sunriver.  As a final need in that project, I had to explore the area along the western edge of the Lava Butte flow. Since I was going to be out here I decided to drop a series of caches. All caches are in small plastic storage containers (about 8”x4”x4”) and all are located on the Lava Butte flow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;font:10.0px Geneva;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing:0.0px;"&gt;This cache is located along the contact of the ~78,000 year old “basalt of Bend” and the ~7,000 year old Lava Butte flow. This large area of “basalt of Bend” is bounded on the west by the Deschutes River and on the east by the Lava Butte flow. The Shevlin-Hixon logging camp was located near Lava Island from 1916 to 1921 and sometime during that time period this area was logged.  How did the logs get across the river to the Shevlin-Hixon railroad?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;font:10.0px Geneva;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing:0.0px;"&gt;Due to the remote location no attempt was made to hide the cache other than placing it in a sheltered location.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

This was the fourth stop for a cache I hadn't done on our hike of 9.67 miles over 10 long hours. Made the find after some looking and a nice hide. Actually parked and started our hike from the end of Osage Rd. but after hiking over to #3 we decided to do these last two instead of hiking back the way we came. A real challenge getting back to civilization from this area of the lava flow. Did manage to hike around the lava sufficiently for this one that the find was made without having to climb in the lava again. TFTH. TNLNSL</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">In from WV this week and Bubblegummers took me for a caching hike I'll never forget.  9.8 mile hike today starting at end of Osage Rd and gathering all of the lava flow series.  My feet are aching, had to stop at the Deschutes and grab some water, saw lots of elk sign in the pines on the Deschutes side of the flow.  I'm done with walking the lava though. The walk back after this one was painful. After 8 miles on my feet I was done.  The lava is the toughest terrain I've ever traversed.  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

It wasn't there and after further contemplation, that monkey was not visible from the mentioned section of trail, so I had to rule it out.  Maybe it was the light or the time of day, but I was having a hard time coming up with another monkey.  I did locate a pretty cool Galapagos lizard, but it was not there either.  Finally I located a monkey with it's head thrown back, hollering.  I hiked up there and made the find.

found the right spur into this one and dodged a few rocks weaving my way close by. didn't realize that there was such a system of foot trails in the area.  nobody around until i was on my way out when i met a small pickup loaded with young boys who were headed to the woods to get high or murder someone. who knows i got the hell out of there!!!

found the right spur into this one and dodged a few rocks weaving my way close by.  nobody around until i was on my way out when i met a small pickup loaded with young boys who were headed to the woods to get high or murder someone.  who knows i got the hell out of there!!!</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Last of three I wanted to do before it got warm today and I had to start my weekend chores.  Little did I know the fates would be aligned against me.  I completed Green Acres and continued to this cache on the road.  I missed a rather large rock that was perfectly hidden in the shadows.  It stopped my pickup immediately.  Luckily I hit it with the tire which is at least 6 ply (thanks goodness).  After pushing a few loose teeth back in I got within .12 and hiked to the coordinates.  I didn't locate it immediately and began the search process.  The gun shots began to ring out.  There was a lot of yelling and lots of gunfire.  It didn't appear to be in my direction, but it was unsettling nonetheless because it was only about 100 yards away.  I continued the search with renewed vigor, trying hard to get out of there.  No luck.  The gun fire turned into motorcycle engines and they rode up the trail right towards where my vehicle was parked.  I scrambled down and back to my pickup to ensure it wasn't being tampered with.  The two men were wearing large packs on their backs but rode by after pausing.  I went back to the cache and began searching again, but still no luck.  The motorcyclists came back and stopped below me.  I'm sure they didn't know where I was.  They rode off once again towards my pickup and I decided my searching was over for the day.  No smiley for me today.  I did look over the area very well but I wasn't able to locate the cache.  I kept the coords and will try again on another day.

Day seems to quickly be going from sunny to overcast, and I know there was the expectation of rain in the forecast. Here's hoping the little drops I feel stay small and don't turn into the storm the look of the sky is promising. Beautiful area and a nice day for a walk around.

No trees were killed to send this message, but a large number of electrons were terribly inconvenienced.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The rock formation, which we've nicknamed Weathertop (if you know that reference, yay), is most likely a deposit from a receding glacier in the distant past. Are you a geologist with a better explanation? Please let us know!

The cache location is fairly obvious, but it will require a little climbing. Look for a standard ammo can.

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is the fifth in a series of eight earthcaches being developed at major points of interest in Newberry National Volcanic Monument in cooperation with the staff of the Deschutes National Forest. Lava River Cave is closed to all entry from November 1 to April 30 to protect hibernating bats. For the remainder of the year (May 1 to October 31) the cave is open to the public. The cave entrance is staffed from approximately Memorial Day to Labor Day. &lt;b&gt;No logs for this earthcache will be accepted from November 1 to April 30.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To log this cache you will need to go more than half way through the cave and you will need a tape measure. Please post a photo taken in the cave. There are three interpretive signs in the cave, e-mail me the "sign titles" and "width of the cave" at each of the signs (to the nearest foot).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While doing this earthcache you may also be able to collect the necessary information to claim several waymarks in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.earthcache.org" title="Earthcache Portal"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.geosociety.org/earthcache/pageGraphics/earthcache_32.gif" border="0" alt /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://imgcdn.geocaching.com/cache/359109c0-94f7-499b-b8ca-09a01c44c269.jpg?rnd=0.0102908" alt="Lave River Cave Entrance" width="100" height="102" hspace="5" align="left" /&gt;Lava River Cave is an excellent example of a lava tube and is the longest continuous tube in Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://imgcdn.geocaching.com/cache/8ee86116-806b-4d6c-b8c7-519a09dc2481.jpg?rnd=0.9819256" alt="The Stairs in Lava River Cave" width="100" height="174" align="right" /&gt;During long-lived eruptions flowing lava becomes channelized into a few main streams. Overflows of lava from these streams solidify quickly and plaster on to the channel walls, building natural walls that allow the level of the lava to be raised. Lava streams that flow steadily in a confined channel for many hours to days may develop a solid crust or roof and thus change gradually into streams within lava tubes. If molten rock (magma) stops rising to the surface at the source, the still-molten lava moving beneath the crusted-over top of a lava flow can continue to drain downhill and may ultimately leave an open lava tube cave. Because the walls and roofs of such tubes are good thermal insulators, lava flowing through them can remain hot and fluid much longer than surface flows. Tube-fed lava can be transported for great distances from the eruption sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newberry Volcano has been the source of numerous high volume tube-fed lava flows that have flowed northward well beyond Bend. These high volume flows generally come from small spatter/fissure vents. These vents were typically low on the flanks of Newberry. The highest elevation vent was in the area of Mokst Butte but it has been buried by Mokst Butte and its flows. The eruption from this vent occurred about 74,000 years ago and resulted in a flow which nearly reaches Redmond and underlies much of Bend. Lava River Cave was a major tube that carried the flow westward to the Deschutes River.&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">LeafySeaDragon and I started a road trip today to grab the 5 Oregon geocaches dating back to the year 2000. Of course we decided to grab other geocaches along the way. We set up a list of Earth Caches, Virtual Caches and Large Caches on the road from Davis to Medford. During our 3rd day of caching we drove from Klamath Falls to Sandy where we stayed the night before going after GC12, GC17 and GCA5. We hit 3 thunder storms with hail on our drive. A strong rain storm hit just as we were exiting the cave which gave us a beautiful picture and wet clothes. Thank you for setting up this Earth Cache. We had planned to stop here if possible but hadn't programmed into our route so we were thrilled when we found out where the Earth Cache was located.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Out on a six day caching road trip from California to Oregon and back with rmhopper to pick up the five Oregon caches hidden in 2000. Way too much bushwhacking on the way to three of the five.  Memo to self: do not start bushwhacking when you are a little over 0.65 miles to GZ.  Then again, I cannot think of any future cache I would be this eager to get.  Lesson learned.  I need to work on finding easier paths to the cache and back, not just back from the cache.

It's a good thing I packed my headlamp.  But I soon learned that it wasn't as useful on my head.  I held it low so I could see the contours of the cave better.  It was a lot of fun walking through, but next time I need two lights.  One to see where I'm going, and one to see where I'm looking at.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was a great place to visit on a day with such hot weather. It was a refreshing and interesting walk to the end of the cave. There were a few times when we didn't see any other groups ahead or behind us, but then we'd come across a large group going the other direction from us. The first sign was easy to miss, but we got them all during our visit.

Answers have been emailed to the cache owner. Thanks for maintaining this EC.  TFTC!

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well I couldn't see the updated coordinates in the log on my gps, so I searched everywhere within a 75 foot radius.  I also couldn't see any sign of a camp, so the clue wasn't much help either.  After getting home and plugging in the updated coordinates, it looks like they were more like 125 feet away, not 25...just in case anyone else runs into the same problem.  Still not sure if I was looking for an ammo can of a film canister.
Thanks,

Beware of muggles, this cave is very busy during the summer months. It is generally open mid May thru mid September. It is a great place to go on a hot summer day. Tempertures in the cave average in the low 40 degrees F. There is an EarthCache here and you are encouraged to get it if the cave is open. You are looking for a bison tube so BYOP. This site is not available during the winter months due to snow.</groundspeak:long_description>

We certainly used the picture to help us locate the final. Always glad to find something that hasn't been signed in over a year.

No trees were killed to send this message, but a large number of electrons were terribly inconvenienced.</groundspeak:text>

Bend (about 15 miles round-trip) or a hike from various access
points (Forest Pass required May thru October at closest parking).
The narrow trails get crowded on summer weekends. You can combine
this with several other caches along the river.
&lt;p&gt;Reception drifts in the trees. The posted coordinates were
averaged 20 minutes and fall in the center of several other
readings so they should be close.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The starting coordinates will put you in the parking lot at the summit of Lava Butte, which is a Recreation Fee Site so a parking pass is required.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is the last in a series of eight earthcaches being developed at major points of interest in Newberry National Volcanic Monument in cooperation with the staff of the Deschutes National Forest. The Lava Butte summit is usually accessible by car from mid-May to late-October. The road can be hiked during the off season. This earthcache is located along the Lava Butte Trail at the summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To log this earthcache please post your favorite photo from this site and e-mail me the answers to the following questions (according to information on the signs along the Crater Rim Trail):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Note: The original signs this earthcache was based on were replaced with new ones in the fall of 2013. The earth cache has now been updated with new questions (May 2014).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What state is Newberry Volcano about the same size as?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many miles of the Deschutes River channel were filled by flows from Lava Butte?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are more than how many volcanoes in the Cascade Range?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At N 43° 55.045'  W 121° 21.470' there is a 10” diameter pine, about 4 feet to the north of the tree is a large vesicular spatter bomb that is cut in half, what is the length and height of the exposed face of the bomb?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While doing this earthcache you may also be able to collect the necessary information to claim multiple waymarks in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

About 7,000 years ago activity along the rift began with fire fountaining along the segment and small flows from the fountains. After a few days activity localized at the location of Lava Butte and a cinder cone began to form. As degassed magma rose in the cone it broke through the thin south side of the cone and fed a series lava flows that spread to the west and north blocking the Deschutes River.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the summit of Lava Butte there is a 360 degree view of Central Oregon. Cascade peaks are visible from Mt. Adams in Washington to Mt. Scott in Crater Lake N.P.&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">visiting from Washington State. Took the bus to the summit. You can walk the two miles up but cant drive your own vehicle up anymore. Enjoyed the quarter mile loop and looking at all the volcanoes out there. Bachelor was beautiful.  Toured the visitor center, bought some books and watched a video in the center. Great day.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Really cool area and a nice little adventure into the lava. We'd tried for your multi just before this so we were happy to get this one and get a letter for the bonus. I tried finding the cache first but didn't see it and then I sent in a friend and she found it, glad one of us was able to locate the prize. Super sweet location and a fun cache to find while out in this beautiful area, I love the lava.

No trees were killed to send this message, but a large number of electrons were terribly inconvenienced.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;Hike thru the pit on the trail, then find your way down the ridge. A nice view point on a clear day.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of caches located at USFS mineral resource pits, within the Deschutes National Forest. These pits are listed and named in the Bend District Materials Sources Land Management Plan as a mineral resource. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tribute to building our forest road system, these quarries remain as a historic reminder of a time gone by. While some are still in production, many of these are located in very scenic spots throughout forest, but are not currently maintained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intent of this series is to find the “lost quarries” that have been abandoned, and are in the process of being reclaimed by mother nature. A short hike will be required thru the quarries to find the caches.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We suggest parking at the end of the road and going for a walk!  Driving into these areas may result in damage to the area and/or your rig. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With over 160 official quarries and pits, located in remote locations throughout the forest, look for future lost quarry caches to come!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy caching.&lt;/p&gt;

Well I drove here might as well try it, (I HATE LAVA) got about 100' and drew first blood on the shins, should I quit? No. finally got out about 1/4 mile and seemed to get a little easier to go in a straight line (kind of). finally made it to GZ didn't have any trouble finding the cache. Took the TB since it had been here awhile. Well now that I am halfway done (I HATE LAVA) sat down in shade to cool off and have something to eat but the mosquitoes were hungrier than I was and so headed back. Was a little easier to get back using trackback on the GPS. Longest 2 miles I ever walked, would love to give it a favorite point but not going to   (I HATE LAVA) it wasn't any fun.

My feet are absolutely decimated, but it was a lot of fun. While I knew this was going to be difficult, I didn't think it'd take me 20 minutes to travel 100 feet in the direction I needed to go sometimes. I told my fiance, it looked easier on the map. Apparently I say this a lot. I need to put it on a T-Shirt. Glad I was able to get out here in my last couple days before moving to Salem.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The starting coordinates will put you in the parking lot at Lava Lands Visitor Center, which is a Recreation Fee Site so a parking pass is required.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is the seventh in a series of eight earthcaches being developed at major points of interest in Newberry National Volcanic Monument in cooperation with the staff of the Deschutes National Forest. The Lava Lands area is usually accessible by car from mid-May to mid-November. This earthcache is along The Trail of the Molten Land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To log this cache post your favorite photo along the trail and e-mail me the answers to the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obtain coordinates for the trail name sign at the beginning of the Trail of the Molten Land.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given that the base of Lava Butte in the breach is at N 43° 54.910' W 121° 21.452' what is the distance and heading (from True North) across the flow to the base from the trail sign (above).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to a trail signs, how many square miles does the lava field cover?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to a trail sign, explosive eruptions from Newberry reached as far as “_______” and “______”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to a trail sign, how many places on the Deschutes River were blocked by the lava flow?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While doing this earthcache you may also be able to collect the necessary information to claim more than a dozen waymarks in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.earthcache.org" title="Earthcache Portal"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.geosociety.org/earthcache/pageGraphics/earthcache_32.gif" border="0" alt /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

About 7,000 years ago activity along the rift began with fire fountaining along the segment and small flows from the fountains. After a few days activity localized at the location of Lava Butte and a cinder cone began to form. As degassed magma rose in the cone it broke through the thin south side of the cone and fed a series of lava flows that spread to the west and north blocking the Deschutes River.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trail of the Molten Land takes you out across the flows to their source on the south flank of Lava Butte. Along the trail there are a series of interpretive signs about some of the many features. At the upper end of the trail is the Phil Brogan Viewpoint with a view across the lava flow to the Cascades.&lt;/p&gt;

Just felt like taking a walk after work today. Please only take an item if you need it. I did.

If you find this cache, I think you are going to be in a very small club of "above average human beings that like to find things".</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well, the Mrs. had other plans for the day so I thought I would punish myself and do the four caches out in the lava fields that we hadn't gotten to. They were LavaFlowAGoGo http://coord.info/GC2ANK8, Hawaiian Oasis Hideout http://coord.info/GC2TPG4, Putter's Happy Place http://coord.info/GC3EKNJ and Sydney's Super Bowl Stash 2011 http://coord.info/GC2NERZ. Ended up hiking about 9 miles in 7.75 hours with total ascent on the two hikes of about 1050 ft. I figure about half of the miles were over lava which made for a long day. 

This was my first trip into the lava this morning and used the parking area near the end of Ochoco Circle. Had a couple of spots both going and coming where I had to change routes as the fissures were just too wide where I was ending up. Wish I would have had a cache container with me as I found another wonderful spot for a cache while roaming the lava. Great location but nasty to get to. TFTH.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">After elkjim and I decided to try our luck on this one we looked for a good place to park for the adventure. Elkjim's son led the way and got us to the cache in good condition, didn't need any aid supplies. Good thing he is part mountain goat.
After finding the cache and a short rest we headed back to the rig.  Found a much better route and made it back in good shape.  See all the posts from past finders, they are all accurate and apply.  
Glad I had someone to go with me and share the adventure.  Not sure if I want to go get the two others out in the lava now.
I think I thank you for the hike in a massive rockpile.  Now quit picking on me!!!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This cache uses anagrams. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging all the letters of another word or phrase. For instance, thorn, shout, seat, and stew are anagrams for north, south, east and west. And the seemingly nonsensical title is actually an anagram describing the cache location, but you don't need to know that much right now. =)</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Since this cache is not at the listed coordinates, you will have to get the correct ones from anagrams. For instance, if I gave you "throw unneeded events", you could rearrange the letters to get "two-hundred seventeen". (Three digit numbers will include the word "hundred".) You get the ripe cut, er, picture at this point, so here are your coordinates. Start rearranging.

N (to the ferry)° (if they gift).(they rent two unhindered)
W (noteworthy nun needed)° (went to fury).(drew food unhurt)

Since there are two possibilities each for the hundredths digits, that gives 4 possible combinations of coordinates. The correct ones will add up to 794. Also, consider that the terrain rating is NOT a 5, nor is "boat" listed under attributes. Narrows things down quite nicely.

The container is currently a small. It is no longer hidden in the same place it was previously, but is within a couple of feet. Use the hint.  Muggles can sneak up on you pretty suddenly here, so be sneaky and/or patient if the situation requires it.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This Earthcache is located at a viewpoint along the Cascade Lakes Scenic Byway. To get credit for this, you will need to read the information sign and take in the view of the many cinder cones surrounding Newberry Volcano.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;h2&gt;Cinder Cone Fields&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cinder cones, also known as scoria cones, can occur alone but commonly occur in groups or fields where dozens to hundreds of cones are found in one area. That is what you are viewing now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standing at the viewpoint, you can see the northwest flank of Newberry Volcano in the distance. Newberry is a large shield volcano that is covered with cinder cones, each of which came from a vent that opened up on the side of the volcano. As many as 400 cinder cones have been identified on the sides of Newberry. For comparison, there are about 300 cinder cones along the edges of the famous Hawaiian shield volcano Mauna Kea, and fewer than 100 cinder cones along the sides of another well-known shield volcano, Mt. Etna in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This large grouping of cones was formed during the 400,000 years of volcanic activity at Newberry. In some cases, “cone crowding” occurred when younger cinder cones formed over the top of older cones, sometimes nearly burying them. The LIDAR image below shows the multitude of cinder cones surrounding Newberry Volcano (the center of the volcano is the caldera with two lakes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/0b3d487f-a597-4d70-8b4f-395ee74104bf.png?rnd=0.6957056" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cinder Cone Shapes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cinder cones are typically formed when runny/foamy molten rock (magma) is spewed into the air during an eruption, and then hardens before falling back to earth as fragments called “cinders”. The bursts of magma usually occur every few minutes until eventually the cinders pile up and create a cone-shaped mound with a bowl-shaped crater on top. Cinder cones usually form rapidly, erupting for days, weeks or months, and when they are done they normally do not erupt again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a distance, the Newberry cinder cones may look fairly similar . . . steep-sided, symmetrical hills. However not all cinder cones are textbook-perfect, oddball shapes do occur. Non-standard shapes include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asymmetrical cone&lt;/strong&gt; – an oval or elongated shape created by cinder build-up on the downwind side of the cone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breached cone&lt;/strong&gt; – an amphitheater or horseshoe shape created when a lava flow breaks out the side of the cinder cone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secant cone&lt;/strong&gt; – a bisected-cone shape created when lava flows break out two sides of the cinder cone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twin cone&lt;/strong&gt; – a double-crater shape created when the position of the underlying vent is altered during the eruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nested cone&lt;/strong&gt; – created when the power of the eruption varies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eroded cone&lt;/strong&gt; – on young cones, a bowl-shaped crater on top marks where cinders exploded from the vent. On older cones the craters have usually eroded away, leaving a smooth top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see some of these non-standard cinder cone shapes in the LIDAR image above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Logging this Earthcache&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please send an email with answers to the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. According to the sign, how often does Newberry Volcano erupt?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. How many years ago did lava pour out of Lava Butte?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Name three of the cinder cones on the flanks of Newberry Volcano.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Klawhop Butte is a cinder cone with two craters. Explain how these might have formed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photos are welcome, but not required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have emailed your answers, feel free to log your find immediately - you do not need to wait for a response. Please do not post the answers to the questions within your log. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

The cache contains lots of goodies including some from the original Bounce contest. 

Traveler Sparky the Fireman is guarding the cache!  Tired from 9 -11 and from fighting those fires in Oregon and California, he just wants to travel to all the beautiful places in Oregon for a little R &amp; R.

Be careful out there.  Dogs and princesses might best be left at home for this one.  Good balance and footwork are essential – test every step.  For some reason the GPS goes bonkers here, so the coordinates are simply meant to help you see the summit, not the cache.  When you see the summit, you can put your GPS away.
 
The cache box is located about 40 feet or so more or less, from the summit as perceived from the direction of Bend. Advanced rock climbing skills are not required. The cache is not in the Manzanita.  Look carefully in all the usual places. The cache is in plain view if you are looking in the right direction</groundspeak:long_description>

Yes it is. It is not "Archived".

Please read all of the history of this iconic Geocache. It is a "Difficult", Award Winning Geocache that is actually very simple and quick if you read the instructions, the comments and notes.

It looks to us like you are trying to get rid of any iconic Geocaches that are not cache and Dash. Please contact me by regular email to discuss this. I have a hundred followers going back to 1992 that will be interested in your comments.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Your National Forests offer a wide variety of recrational activities. I had the pleasure of opening this one back in 1974. Millions of people have visited this site, it is a fun place. This is a Recreation Fee site, but the cache can be obtained with out going into the fee area. When the site is open there can be many eyes looking at you, so be careful and use stealth. Also be aware of the traffic. The site is usually open mid May thru September. There are nature trails, a vistor center and one of the better views of central Oregon. There are also two EarthCaches here.
This cache should be available all year, however, winter snows will limit access. This a pill bottle and not much room so BYOP.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">The cache is NOT at the listed coordinates. You have an easy puzzle to solve to get started. After that, it's a straighforward multi: 3 waypoints, then the final. Each waypoint will give you coordinates to the next link in the chain. Take a look at the terrain rating: don't bring your dogs or little ones, and come prepared. You will spend about 1.2 mi. on lava. Attempting this cache when the rocks are wet or covered in snow is discouraged.
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">OK, figured it was about time I put out an actual ammo can. And what better place than out in the lava? But relax, it's not as hard as it sounds. Nothing is buried in the rocks. All the waypoints and the cache are hidden in, on, or under wood. And all hides are within an armspan of significant trees. Hence the name. This isn't a kipuka; just an area with a larger than usual number of trees growing in the lava. Doing this cache will take you on a tour of some of the best in the flow. Things get a little hairy around waypoint 3, but most of the walk is relatively easy (for a lava flow). To begin with, you need to figure out the location of the first waypoint. Any experienced cacher should have no problem with the following puzzle:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N [U + V]° [E x K].[O x Y]&lt;br /&gt;
W [K²]° U.[(N x R x B) - 1]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check your answers for the first waypoint of this puzzle on &lt;a href="http://www.geochecker.com/index.php?code=aff218b285d6aae8782afba14f6cc828&amp;amp;action=check&amp;amp;wp=47433237583744&amp;amp;name=54686520466f7265737420696e2074686520466c6f77"&gt;Geochecker.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you figure out where it is, I'll leave it up to you how to get there. When I placed the cache, there was an active logging operation in the forest nearby, which may affect accessibility if you go mid-week. Each waypoint is housed in a red and white Altoids Smalls tin. They- and the cache- should be easy to find. This multi was designed to give you a tour of a really cool area, not to challenge your container-finding ability. Also, although much of the cache occurs out in the lava, there is a surprising amount of vegetation and some soft soils. Please be mindful of your impact in this harsh environment, and stick to hard surfaces where possible. When you're done, it is possible you may want to exit the lava field at a place different from where you entered. Walking along the edge of the lava flow rather than backtracking makes for an enjoyable loop of about 2 miles. Congrats markellie, D'cacher and buzzman0606 on the team effort FTF!&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Wow, what an adventure this was!  I knew it was going to be a long trek across the lava, but still...  Wow!  You definitely don't want to stumble and fall on that stuff, but nevertheless I found it fun in a challenging sort of way.  I began the journey in the afternoon, and a large thundercloud was rolling in from the east.  While making my way to the 2nd stage, there was a bright flash followed almost immediately by a loud thunderclap, so I'm fairly sure the lightning bolt must have struck the cinder cone behind me, maybe 1/3 of a mile away.  It made me a little nervous about climbing the small ridge where the 2nd stage was hidden, but after that the lightning activity subsided.

At stage 3, I almost had to accept defeat and log a DNF, which would have been a HUGE disappointment.  It was clear that a rodent (or entire family of rodents) had made a home out of the hiding spot, as there were tunnels leading through and all around the hiding spot mentioned in the hint.  I looked and looked, but eventually became convinced that the wildlife had displaced the cache.  However, after a lengthy and desperate search, I eventually managed to find the cache about 5 feet further downslope, buried under 6-8 inches of pine needles and bark debris.

I was hesitant to move the cache, but I was even more reluctant to replace it where it was "supposed" to go, since I'm sure it would only be a matter of time before some little rodent would displace it again.  So, I hope it meets with the CO's approval, but I moved the cache about 2 feet away to the base of the tree on the uphill side, and built a secure little housing for the cache container out of rocks.  I think it should be very safe now.

At that point, I realized that I was equidistant from both the final stage and my car, so after some consideration and map reconnaissance I decided that the most expedient course was to hike out of the lava back towards my car, then drive closer to the final stage and access it from there.  That worked out fine, and I was thrilled to finally reach the final cache.  It's doing great, although after almost 2 years I think it was a little lonely.

By the way, while I was out here I also went and found another challenging lava field cache called Green Mountain (GCVY1B), which hadn't been found in over 4 years!  Unfortunately, Green Mountain was archived several months ago over a technicality, but the cache is still there and doing just fine.  If you enjoyed this cache, you might want to look up Green Mountain as well; find it, and you can still log it even though it's archived.  If you take the most direct route, you'll spend less time on the lava, but you'll have to force your way through some thick manzanita (MUCH worse than the lava, in my opinion).  So if a machete isn't part of your standard caching toolkit, you might want to consider adding one for this cache.  http://coord.info/GCVY1B</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Solved the puzzle last night and decided to go for a walk on the lava today!  This is a very well done multi - nice area and great views.  Lots of ups and down over lava ridges, but at lest we were able to find the "quick" way back.  Took us about 2.5 hrs to do the 2.5 mile trip.  Very fun...this one gets a favorite point.

There are multiple ways to get here from road 4613. One of the ways (road 300) you must have no regard for your vehicle's paint job and have good clearance. This is the route we took, and we cleared 2 downed trees from this route for you. It would also make a good route to mountain bike. The family sedan should be able to make it within a 1/4 mile or so using another route.

You cannot drive far past the cache because there is a very large tree over the road that has likely been there for years. If you have a large vehicle, please find a good spot to turn around before the cache, or else you'll be making a tight turnaround in the road.

An acquaintance of mine says he found out about a mountain bike route that goes by here from an "old" (80's?) mountain biking book. We hope that you enjoy this spot!</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p style="margin:0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;font:10.0px Geneva;"&gt;For the last eight years I’ve been volunteering with the U.S. Geological Survey during the summer as a field assistant to help with the geologic mapping of Newberry Volcano. Over the last few months I’ve been exploring the relationship between the Deschutes River and the western margin of the “basalt of Bend” from Tumalo to Sunriver.  As a final need in that project, I had to explore the area along the western edge of the Lava Butte flow. Since I was going to be out here I decided to drop a series of caches. All caches are in small plastic storage containers (about 8”x4”x4”) and all are located on the Lava Butte flow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing:0.0px;"&gt;This cache is located in a kipuka of the ~78,000 year old “basalt of Bend” surrounded ~7,000 year old Lava Butte flow. The old canyon rim of the Deschutes River prior to the Lava Butte flow forms the western margin of the kipuka. The Lava Butte flow spilled into the old canyon from the north and south to form the kipuka. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;font:10.0px Geneva;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing:0.0px;"&gt;Due to the remote location no attempt was made to hide the cache other than placing it in a sheltered location.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

This was the last stop for a cache I hadn't done on our hike of 9.67 miles over 10 long hours. Made the find after some looking and a nice hide. Actually parked and started our hike from the end of Osage Rd. but after hiking over to #3 we decided to do the last two instead of hiking back the way we came. A real challenge getting back to civilization from this area of the lava flow. Did manage to hike around the lava sufficiently again for this one and the find was made without having to climb on too much lava again. TFTH. TNLNSL</groundspeak:text>

My feet are aching, had to stop at the Deschutes and grab some water, saw lots of elk sign in the pines on the Deschutes side of the flow. I'm done with walking the lava though. The walk back after this one was painful. After 8 miles on my feet I was done.  We made our way out closest we could find and called for a pickup as we sat on the road wondering if we'd ever walk again. TFTC

Plus I wanted to show them how to better use their phones for geocaching. Walked by this one before looking back and seeing it. We ended up doing a lot of path switching, going back and forth from the trail that is close by the lava and the trail that's a little wider but farther away form the desolation of the butte. I always love any excuse to come out by the lava.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Log jumped and brush dived straight up the hill after the starter cache. Got to the top and found a trail. Most of the nearby mountains greeted me as well as the big dead ponderosa that got hit by lighting. I think I could see the tip of Mt Thieison way down south. The trail is actually a bike trail (of course) that is steep, loose and deep going over boulders. Crazy ride for brave hearts. Walked down a 100 feet or so and jumped off to bushwhack back down. The trail seemed to go not where I wanted to. Love those butte hikes BD. Thanks. Fav.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This terrain can be treacherous, so watch your footing, take your time, and use good judgement (advice the Interns could stand to follow). Die hard explorers will be rewarded with some up close and personal views of ancient geologic oddities.

You are advised to leave the pups and young ones at home. You also should not attempt this in the rain or snow, as good visibility of the terrain and holes beneath your feet is important. 

You may want to combine this with Man vs. Lava, as you probably won't want to visit this area twice (this one is even worse than M vs. L).</groundspeak:long_description>

I definitely earned my stars on this one, exploring every crack and crevice.  At one point I actually had to stop and ask myself if I would be willing to cut off my own leg or drink my own urine if it came to that...but fortunately it didn't.  Made the final ascent and had quite a nice sit with the cache.  Windy and cool today, but beautiful as well.

Bachelor, my eye is often drawn down to the big red spot by the Dechutes River. I got curious one day and found the spot. Thought it was worth putting a cache here, so I did.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">When I arrived at the Big Red Spot it looked like a war zone. I was sad to see all the shooting debris and the bodies of two hapless tv sets that had gone to electronics heaven. Walked to GZ and came upon either some kind of homeless camp or maybe base camp for the tv killers. There was a little table and chair, a bag full of some kind of bottles it looked like, some other odds and ends, and I kid you not: a big stuffed lion guarding the place. There didn't seem to be anybody around so I made my find and got out of there as quick as possible. The cache was in good shape and will hopefully miss the eyes of whoever is stomping around up there. TFTH!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The cache is in Caldera Springs,  a rich forested setting splashed with acres of lakes for kayaking and canoeing plus miles of streams and trails. A congenial Lake House is a great place for relaxing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can drive or bike to this cache. You can even hike here from the nearby Sunriver Business Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the clubhouse is a bridge over the lake.  Take a hike to the bridge, enjoy the tranquil waters and rest a bit at the clubhouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon &amp;amp; Garfinkel lent no hand in creating this bridge, but the tune may dance through your mind. &lt;/p&gt;

Since I have seen a log by Putter, I know he just loves the black abyss of the lava flow, it's his "happy place". 
Was out with dirtworshiper, so he could grab DLE &amp; MvsL. Whilst at a stop to pick our route, we both turned around &amp; seen this massive old juniper. It's not super tall but it sure is fat. Man, how did we miss that? Cuz we was looking down almost the whole way.

Cache is a few feet from the tree. Please do not dig through the tree, just ponder it's existence in this stark landscape.

May want to employ the buddy system, for these lava caches.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well, the Mrs. had other plans for the day so I thought I would punish myself and do the four caches out in the lava fields that we hadn't gotten to. They were LavaFlowAGoGo http://coord.info/GC2ANK8, Hawaiian Oasis Hideout http://coord.info/GC2TPG4, Putter's Happy Place http://coord.info/GC3EKNJ and Sydney's Super Bowl Stash 2011 http://coord.info/GC2NERZ. Ended up hiking about 9 miles in 7.75 hours with total ascent on the two hikes of about 1050 ft. I figure about half of the miles were over lava which made for a long day. 

This was my second stop of the morning and on this hike I actually got a two'fer as I picked up the Putter's cache during this entry into the lava field. Got to this one rather quickly once I navigated around the valley instead of going down and up. Great location for a cache.TFTH. TNL"[b][pink]DUBBLE BUBBLE[/b][/pink]"SL</groundspeak:text>

Made a quick find here &amp; headed for the other 2 caches farther west. Thanks for the spot on coord's.</groundspeak:text>

When we got to ground zero we actually saw two trucks parked in the area but they quickly left. The find was pretty quick log was dry and everything ship shape.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Ever wished you could geocache day and night? Now you can! Cougar's
lair, a cache, is an easy .17 miles from the starting point,
following reflective "cougar eyes" with a bright flashlight. The
Terrain is easy, but watch your step! This cache has been done at 4
am, it has been done in 6 inches of snow, and now it can be done by
you!</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a night time only cache. Young kids especially like this
cache because they can follow the reflectors. Big kids like it
also. 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=
"http://img.groundspeak.com/cache/ff4c91e6-ea0c-4364-9234-aa1f0d04b5c7.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some quotes from cachers "Very creative...great for
kids...awsome cache...best concept I've seen...I'm scared...so
clever" The start is a short drive from Bend or Sun River. When you
get to the starting coordinates, look south for the silver "Cougar
Eye" reflectors. Getting there by car is easy. From the south, just
follow your GPS. From the north, the safest approach is to do a
U-Turn at Lava Lands visitor's center and then approach from the
south. There is also "night lights" at Ogden group camp on the way
up Paulia Peak. Getting home is the most important part. Bring at
least two bright flashlights. You may decide to leave your car's
head lights or parking lights on just to make the return trip
easier. You will need your GPS, and the start coordinates, to
return to your car. The cache, an ammo can, is nestled .17 miles
from the start, and marked with a red reflector. Fun toys that
either light up or glow in the dark are suggested. No trees or
cougars were injured in the making of this geocache. .&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I needed a 5 star terrain or difficulty for the Geocaching Road Trip '15 so 0.6 mile into the lava flow seemed like a good idea and I could go after the other three caches out here too since they were only a few tenths of a mile apart. Well, 3.5 miles later my aching body finally emerged from the lava flow and another 3 mile hike on the roads to get back to the car. At least I got my 5 star terrain.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I love it out here!  The trail could use a little maintenance, but then that would take away from why I love it out here.  Damn it's good to be home!  I was fascinated by the pine tree growing right out of the rock, and even more fascinated by it's root which had a bigger diameter than the tree did.  It was a nice cool and breezy day today...perfect for this kind of cache.

I called my wife to tell her I was OK, but running a little later than I thought I would.  She asked me, "are you bleeding," which would seem like an interesting question if you did not know me.

My response, "no...not any more.  The bleeding stopped.  Do you need anything from the store?"

Thanks,

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">One waypoint and the cache. Another hide that satisfies my fondness for odd containers. Even though the waypoint is not too far from the highway, much safer parking is available on rd. 4610 just down the hill. A pleasant visit to a section of forest between the current and former alignments of Cascade Lakes Hwy. The container is large enough for a coin. Barely.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">OK. I know what you're thinking. "Multi's are a lot of  work. I just want get to the coordinates and sign the log. And a micro in the woods? That'll be too HARD!! I'll never get good reception!" I deny none of this. If you foresee that this cache might make you voice these types of complaints, you should probably give it a miss. If, however, you possess the determination of a true geocacher, you will find a relaxing walk and relevant clues to compensate for the spotty reception found in a thick forest.

I was being eaten by the year's first mosquitoes as I was placing the waypoint, so I didn't put the usual effort into making sure the coordinates were solid. It will be pretty clear what your target is, though, so it shouldn't pose a problem. The waypoint will give you the coordinates to the final. Don't look to the title for help; it won't mean a darned thing until you find it. The container can be retrieved without moving any logs, rocks, seesaws, or other common forest objects. And there is no need to get neck-deep in vegetation. I CAN tell you that you will feel it before you see it.

At the site of the final, be patient. Whether it's tree cover, minerals in the rocks, or GPS-fogging spells cast by the gnomes, reception acts kind of weird here. During one visit, my GPS said 60' as I walked up to GZ. I set it down and it zeroed out five minutes later. I suggest finding a high spot and letting your signal calm down a bit before beginning your search in earnest. 

As always, I like my caches to be found, so feel free to request assistance if your visit proves fruitless.

The signal bounces all around. 
Just shake a branch and follow sound.

I really loved the waypoint though and was eager to find the final so I could favorite it. Well it turns out that on a night time FTF adventure GPS51111 decided to show me where it was since she had gone back independently and found it. Somehow I always manage to forget the coin I want to stick in it but I’m sure I’ll come by this way again. Favorite from me for such a lovely waypoint.

No trees were killed to send this message, but a large number of electrons were terribly inconvenienced.</groundspeak:text>

The best drive in spot is between Cottonwood road and the Lava Butte Center Interpretive Center on the east side of the highway. Otherwise its up to you.

This is a great area of lava formations to explore.

No spoilers in your log, right?

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I've been looking at this cache for awhile.  I had several I wanted to get to before I tackled this one.  Today there was no excuse.  I went out to see if I was worthy.  I spent a whole bunch of time at the forst waypoint, as it sounds others have as well.  I was looking for one certain kind of thing and periodically checking for other possble things.  In self reflection, its funny how much I cuss about the tough ones, but it feels awesome when you finally find it.  I did eventually locate it and I was off to the others.  There were odd holes drilled into the lava nearby that were very curious.  Nothing to do with the cache or waypoints but interesting nonetheless.  The second waypoint was easy after the first and it appears that both are currently here.  The old one that was replaced and the new one.  The cache was in excellent shape.  I made my mark in the log and replaced it as I found it.  Didn't see another soul until I drove to the next cache I wanted to do.  I saw a white jeep that seemed to be camping in some unconventional manner.  Thanks for drawing me to such a beautiful place on such a fabulous day and thanks for the Multi-Smiley!!

spent a long time at the first wp going up and going down before finally finding the little guy.  yeah it was where i was first looking but just didn't see it.  wp 2 and the final were gimmes.

glad i didn't have to spend too much time out on the lavas as it was getting a might warm plus i didn't have my good boots on.  this one has been on my list for a bit so glad i finally got to do it.  last one for the day.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I placed this cache on top of a quarry accross from the entrance to
Sun River. Make your way to the top by way of 4x4 or hiking. Just
follow the winding road to the top(trust me, its easier this way). 
&lt;p&gt;Once you have followed the road to the top, you will notice a
fantastic view of the surrounding area. On top you will need to
find the nearest 2 large trees. They are close together. Look
between these two trees to line up a burnt stump and the only
little tree behind it (by about 10 yards). The cache is hidden
close by the little tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware that there are Madrone trees in the area, and
cachers leggs have been known to get scratched up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: This area is a "multi-use". This includes sledders in the
winter, 4X4'ers in the summer, and target shooters all year
around.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Next to the little tree is one small rotten log (it's not  there).  Cache location is 16 feet up the hill in a big log rootball.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

&lt;p&gt;You can bike or hide to this cache from the nearby Sunriver Business Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If driving ask for permission at the Caldera Springs office letting them know what you are doing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't found out what this was or is. If you have an idea as to what this structure might be, please post your idea in your log.There are roads in Caldera Springs and you could park on the road at about 43 51.016N, 121 25.950W and walk to the cache, but please get permission to park first.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This cache is located near Big Spring. There is an interesting place where someone has put a cement waterbox with a pipe leading out of it. Possibly there was a cabin here at one time? We aren't sure of the history so if someone knows put it in your log. We also found another interesting relic that made us wonder how it got here.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Suggested parking coordinates are N 43 58.752 W 121 30.907. There is a narrow forest road that dead ends at a good parking place but I would not drive that road any more since I could not find it on the new forest management road. I don't want anyone getting a ticket for driving that road. The cache is just a nice walk from the listed parking coordinates. 

The cement waterbox is located at N 43 58.841 W 121 30.228. I'm including a picture but it doesn't show the detail very well.

We won the cache container at Bubblegummer's 66 Bash. 

We took several readings of the cache coordinates with 2 GPS units. The readings were consistently the same, yet when we tried to follow the coords back to the cache it was 20' off.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">It may be a little bit easier than the last one, but it's definitely on the high side of a two for terrain.  Fantastic area!  Speaking of the other one, I didn't realize it was not still available.  It did seem awfully close...which was strange, but it was in my gps from last year so I gave it a look, and found it pretty easily.  It definitely would have made my favorite list for the sit and sign location...pretty bummed that I can't log it though...oh wait, found it!

Thanks,
Skadog

Looks like the trail is being redone around here, lots of little orange flags marking out a new but not yet formed trail.

Coords and hint right on, although it is about 100 feet from the trail, not 25, and probably deserves a cliff attribute. I removed a lotion container which was starting to leak but there is another one still there. I can use some lotion as dry as it is although the trail is not too dusty yet. Thanks!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">There is an ammo can located in the bottom of a small canyon a few miles west of bend waiting for you. Turn north off Cascades Lakes Highway on road 4610 and drive to one of the two given parking spots.
The road is a little rough but I know your geo-rig can handle it.

 Hiking from the first parking spot is shorter and has less mud to drive through in the winter but requires more bushwhacking. The second parking spot is on the C.O.D TH (biking trail) and has a direct route down the little canyon.

Parking #1- 43 59.723-121 25.726
Parking #2- 43 59.959-121 26.049

Your choice.

It's hard to even see when the quality caches are published because of all the series caches that spew out regularly. Cool little canyon that looks like it may get more users soon judging by the flagged trail alignment winding along the bottom. The COD trail is in good condition; saw a few cyclists and runners. The 4610 road was being graded so it should be ready for summer traffic, too. Thanks!</groundspeak:text>

Cache was right were it was supposed to be and with a level two difficulty (and in my opinion so should all "outdoor" caches) there is just a piece of it barely visible at the right angle. That is, no need to tear up the landscape looking for it.

We'll be back for the others along this route.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The FTF competition has revealed the true nature of some competitors. They relentlessly assimilate your new caches. They come at all hours without stopping to sleep or eat. A few moments to regenerate and they are off to absorb the next new series put out by an unsuspecting cacher. Their appetite is insatiable. They will beat you. You must comply. Resistance is futile.

&lt;p&gt;It's time for a Goodtime.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;A scenic spot on the top of Ann's butte, with a great spot for a Goodtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks like an old party spot when you could still ATV your way to the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Park at the trail that heads up the old road to the top or start at one of the other caches on the butte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The roads around the base of the butte will take you back to your starting loaction no matter which way you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahh, I need a goodtime!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK51TWD - GC51TWD Parking&lt;br /&gt;N 43° 50.748 W 121° 29.731&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Wow this one took some serious grit and determination to make it to the top.  Once we got there we loved the view and quietness that surrounded this area.  Cache was in great shape, surprised so few have found it (though perhaps this hike uphill is a deterrent).  We were glad to get one for our fizzy challenges so thanks for placing it!</groundspeak:text>

It was worth every part of that T4 as it was quite the steep, long hike to the top (and of course we forgot water lol).  Once we caught our breath at the top we looked around and soon spied the cache container.  Wonderful view and very quiet in this area.  Thanks for taking us to a new part of the Sunriver area!</groundspeak:text>

Little did we know the EASY way was just on the other side (although the trek DOWN to the easy part...a little more tricky!)

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I saw this one on the satellite view, and thought this would be a nice little hike. I thought it would be at the end of the little inlet in the lava. Beautiful hike in, if a little scratchy with the bitterbrush. Got to the end of the road and looked way up that wall of scree and started in a straight line to the top. This is the second week in a row that "Markellie-vation" has led us up a steep climb. Got to the top and enjoyed the view and had some water, then went on towards GZ. Of all things to encounter - there was a swarm of bees. Everywhere. Why would they choose to swarm up here? Avoiding them, we went for another potential location a few yards away, and lucky us, found the cache. Everything is in good shape. We left a carabiner, a puzzle toy, and the metal charm in the gallery photo. We took a lanyard and lots of photos of the view. I can't figure out why this cache doesn't have as more fave points. Gets one from us!</groundspeak:text>

You can approach the cache from either the Points West trailhead (Inn At The Seventh Mountain), Meadow Camp, or Lava Island.

The cache is located within a pretty rocky area, so wear good shoes and probably should avoid bringing the kids on this one (They can watch from up above though). Some bushwhacking may be required depending which way you go, but it's better to go to the top of the rocks and climb down. You'll be looking for a small glass container, big enough to hold a pencil and tiny logbook, and possibly a very small item if you can get it in there.

Enjoy!</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache is a cammo / ammo box with a log. There are some fine wooden goodies...and don't forget to bring the Pup ! It's a great spot to stop and go fishing...rumer has it that locals use Brown Rooster Tails, caddis flies, or a Mepps !  It's even a great place to bring goodies for a nice Bar B Que as the fire grills are provided. If you have a guitar you can sit by a tall Ponderosa Pine tree and sing to nature. There is a wonderful nature walk up river from the cache site if you're feelin' a bit outdoorsy ! Bring a camera as it is very picturesque here, definitely a locals favorite !</groundspeak:long_description>

It is marked as private but is actually public and as I live here I give you permission to search for the cache. There is a basketball hoop, some benches under a roof  and a barbeque. Just over the bridge there is a boat ramp but there is also river access in the park. Most locals dont even know about this nice spot. It makes for a good place to begin a float down the river!

Edit: When the river is high unless you want to go through some deep water the cache may be inaccessible.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">"An equinox occurs twice a year, when the tilt of the Earth's axis
is inclined neither away from nor towards the Sun, the center of
the Sun being in the same plane as the Earth's equator. The term
equinox can also be used in a broader sense, meaning the date when
such a passage happens. The name "equinox" is derived from the
Latin aequus (equal) and nox (night), because around the equinox,
the night and day are approximately equally long. It may be better
understood to mean that latitudes +L and -L north and south of the
Equator experience nights of equal length."

The gravel road is suitable for all vehicles, however most of it is not maintained in the winter.  There's a ton of nearby parking for your car, pickup, RV, tank, or helicopter.

The ammo can was orignally stuffed with both typical and not-so-typical cache items.  Don't feel obligated to "trade up", but leave a unique item if you can.  Since this is not a very challenging cache, let's try to make the contents of the cache the biggest adventure.</groundspeak:long_description>

Ferd again mumbled something like "you got to earn your pie - and besides this is a Markellie so you gotta hike in."  Good thing the wind was blowing so the hint really made sense.

It was originally one of the Bounce contest caches placed during the month of September.  Now this cache is available to everyone!</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Logistics:  Be especially careful on the “washboard“ road as one could end up in the ditch or crashed into an on-coming rig.  Parking spaces are provided near the coordinates; there is no need to park on the road.  A Trailhead Parking Fee is not required (at this time).

Meadow Bounce has been placed about 437 feet at 68 degrees true, from the coordinates (the first Meadow Trailhead bulletin board).  Use your true compass (set at seventeen degrees declination) and your GPS together, to find this cache.

Steve Hayden, USFS trail crew supervisor for the Bend-Ft. Rock Ranger District, and Marv Lang, Recreation Manager, have been working to restore this scenic area for some time, applying modern management ethics to a misused area still called “Meadow Camp” in 1995.  Compacted areas and outlaw user trails have been eliminated.  As you seek this cache, note the most recent and creative restoration work.

The area where Meadow Bounce is cached is a rock climbing and bouldering area, popular due to its proximity to Bend.  Steve and his crew have worked hard to move the main trial away from the riverbank and to give access by several trace trails to the rock cliffs.  PLEASE STAY ON THE DEVELOPED TRAILS AND WAYS IN THIS AREA.

Rock climbing and bouldering are dangerous!  Not long ago, one senior athlete died after he fell about 30 feet from these Meadow cliffs, and later an outdoor parks and recreation leader climbing alone, was hospitalized with broken bones from a fall from these same rocks.  NO ROCK CLIMBING IS NECESSARY TO FIND MEADOW BOUNCE.

Meadow Bounce has lots of trade goods including some from the original Bounce contest.</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Look for a fire-marked stump on a rock when the bearing and distance you have been given are on point.  Meadow Bounce is located about eight lateral feet from a side of the stump, in a logical place and can be seen from some distance if one is looking in the right direction.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Time passes and as we noted in the original description, the coordinates given in the description are those of the "original" USFS sign board in 2002 before Pay to Play charges were imposed.

Note that a "bearing" is a line FROM a point (the old sign location/the coordinates given) TO a second point, the cache.

Note that you are asked to stay on established trails and "WAYS", a typical sly misdirection of the Golden Age of Geocaching, years ago. Have you read all of the comments by successful Finders on your computer, not your smart phone? Has a climbers trace or WAY become overgrow a bit since 2002?

Use your wonderful GPS receiver by projecting the cache location. (Consult your GPS Manual.)

For busy folks who do not read Manuals :-)), You can wander in the direction of 68 degrees TRUE (you surely do have your GPS set to True bearings to match your maps, do you not?? Can you set the direction to TRUE in a smart phone?)

Keep the original coordinates as your GPS GO TO instruction.

When you wander on a "trace" or "way" out 437 feet FROM THE ORIGINAL SIGN, move right or left until you are at the RECIPROCAL of 68 degrees and look for the old burned stump.

We hope this helps!

Another safe parking option is the next side road northbound on HWY 97, opposite the Vandervert road exit (road #9724). Cache is in the middle of the two options.

Some people feel comfortable parking along the hwy so good luck. Cache is on the east side. It's all on you baby.

After the uphill trudge to get it (all our other finds for the day were pretty close to the road so this was the most substantial walk to a cache today) we looked but quickly found it. Only other thing on the hill was horse poo and that wasn't much for company. Cache was healthy and dry which is always a nice to find.

maps are available at bike shops and the Forest Service office.

121&amp;deg;24.193' across the highway from the Forest Service parking
area (fee site). There is also a map posted. If you don't want to
leave your georig at the trailhead, you can poke around the maze of
forest roads and get quite close, but I'll wager that it's faster
walking to the cache.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Our family placed this cache on Mother's day 2014. This being our first cache we were very excited to find just the right spot near one of our favorite trails. We named the cache Heron's perch because we are the Heron family and there are numerous great blue herons found along this stretch of the river. &lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;We found the perfect spot for the cache between 2 trails that run next to the Deschutes river just west of the town of Bend OR. The trailhead starts at Meadow Camp and goes down river. About an 1/8 of a mile down the trail, the trail splits and we found a spot between the upper and lower trails in a lava rock crevice.  My kids spent much of the time balancing on a large ponderosa long the created a bridge over the lower trail. The cache is a plastic container with a screw-on lid that has been painted green and brown to match the surrounding rock and follage, and so it is not mistaken for garbage. &lt;/p&gt;

align="right" /&gt;Phil's Trail was originally known as Twice-Cut Tree
and was one of the first mountain bike trails near Bend. It runs
through a nice little dry canyon. One way to reach the cache is to
pedal the 3 miles from the Forest parking area (no fee required as
of 2004) at N 44&amp;deg;02.612' W 121&amp;deg;23.168' although there are
many other ways.
&lt;p&gt;Satellite reception is fair to poor but the tree is easy to
spot. After the cache, you can continue for many miles on the trail
system, perhaps hitting several other caches in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

Worth it. I'm glad I read the hint before setting out, my coords were a bit off, and the cache was in the last place I looked. Took the trail back to my car, though, which was fun. Lots of photo ops, glad I took my camera. The cache is in great condition, and the contents are less junk-heavy than most caches. Wonderful! TFTC.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Why do things the easy way? Riding by this one seems easy enough, but the trails, though not officially closed, really shouldn't be ridden during winter. And the closest roads ARE officially closed. Last option? Walking in, of course. But a 6-mi. round trip from Phil's Trailhead sounded tedious at best, so I drove along Cascade Lakes Highway with my GPSr on and the waypoint active until I found the closest point. This turned out to be pretty close to the FR 41 junction, so I parked there. It was a little more than 1.5 mi. to the listed coordinates from here. 

It turned out to be a very pleasant adventure. A forest that would be dusty, hot, and full of people in summer was, well, NOT all of those things today. Absolutely peaceful, a de facto wilderness. The open forest offered very easy walking; at no point did I have to travel more slowly than I would on a well-packed trail. I crossed one forest road and 2 mountain bike trails on the way there. Since the cache was offset from the tree toward the direction from which I was coming, I just used a reverse bearing and waited until in said something close to 70' before I began my search. Had to use some caution clambering about on slippery rocks. Spotted a place that actually made me say aloud, "That's where I would have put it." Just as I was about to move on, my eyes caught the lovely, metallic gleam of ammo can. Contents were in great shape. From inspecting the log, it seems I'm the first person foolish enough to have visited in January. After replacing it, found a flat rock up top where I enjoyed a celebratory lunch before the hike back the car. The walk took about 35-40 minutes each way. T4TC/TNLNSL</groundspeak:text>

The cache is not at the posted coodinates and will require the Google Earth application or searching at Wikimapia.org to solve the puzzle.

&lt;p class="MsoNormal" align="baseline"&gt;Scientific evidence suggests that Earth is rapidly warming and some recent studies indicate that there is a direct relationship to &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5441976" style="color:rgb(204, 0, 0);"&gt;Global Warming&lt;/a&gt; and the gases (particularly CO2) we have emitted into the atmosphere.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; PBS featured a &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/warming/" style="color:rgb(204, 0, 0);"&gt;NOVA/Frontline Report April 24, 2007&lt;/a&gt; that offers an excellent overview to the immediate threats brought on by Global Warming.  The &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/warming/etc/graphs.html" style="color:rgb(204, 0, 0);"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Report offers facts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that can help us thread-the-needle in the efforts to reverse the trend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;img src="http://powergridtech.com//Geocache%20Pix/Global%20Warming/CO2.gif" /&gt; &lt;span style="font-family:georgia,times new roman,times,serif;font-style:italic;color:rgb(51, 51, 153);"&gt;"Over a 40 year period, scientist Charles Keeling measured the amount of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub style="font-family:georgia,times new roman,times,serif;font-style:italic;color:rgb(51, 51, 153);"&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:georgia,times new roman,times,serif;font-style:italic;color:rgb(51, 51, 153);"&gt;) in the atmosphere. The above "Keeling Curve" shows the increase in total concentrations of CO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub style="font-family:georgia,times new roman,times,serif;font-style:italic;color:rgb(51, 51, 153);"&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:georgia,times new roman,times,serif;font-style:italic;color:rgb(51, 51, 153);"&gt;in the atmosphere from 1957-1997. This unbroken record of the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere shows how it's gone up, in round numbers, from around 315 parts per million to around 370 parts per million on average today. This data is widely accepted by everyone. (Nova/Frontline Report)"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;A good downloadable tool, Google Earth, can be used fly around the globe and visit some of the past and current point-sources of pollution. As an alternative, you can go to http://www.wikimapia.org and search against the names listed in the Fly To sites&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; You will be visiting the &lt;a href="http://skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?20374745" style="color:rgb(204, 0, 0);"&gt;tallest smoke stacks&lt;/a&gt; in the world!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt; Magna, UT  Kennecott Copper Smelter Stack,  370.4 meters (#4 world highest stack) &lt;img src="http://powergridtech.com//Geocache%20Pix/Global%20Warming/Kennecott3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;a href="http://earth.google.com/" style="color:rgb(204, 0, 0);"&gt;Google Earth&lt;/a&gt; has a “Fly To” tab.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; You will copy a location from the list below, paste it into the tab field and hit the ENTER key on your computer.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Google Earth will fly you to the vicinity of a stack, where you can pan around to observe some interesting features, in addition to the gigantic stacks.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Remember, these stacks are TALL so as to disperse the toxic gases and CO2 downwind from the worksite, but all of the gases then mix into the atmosphere.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; The smelter stacks you will visit have vented mega tonnage of toxic metal waste into the atmosphere during their operational history, along with carbon oxides.  Some of these facilities, such as Kennecott at Magna UT, have been made to be very efficient and even capture the sulfuric acid gases as a commercial byproduct.  To identify the stack site, float your mouse over the small Google Earth icons you see on the satellite hybrid maps. If you don't have Google Earth freeware installed on your computer, just visit the link http://www.wikimapia.org and use the search engine to locate the target stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt; INCO Nickel Smelter Stack,  381 meters (#2 highest stack in the World) (Brazilian Ownership)&lt;img src="http://powergridtech.com//Geocache%20Pix/Global%20Warming/INCO.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;A good example of this acid fallout is the jet-black granite around Greater Sudbury Ontario, where the sulfuric acid rain has penetrated the pink-gray granite to a depth of 3 inches and permanently dyed the granite jet black. &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The INCO Superstack is the tallest freestanding chimney in the Western hemisphere, with a height of 381 m (1,257 ft).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;At each “Fly To”&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; location, zoom down to where you can see the stack opening and float your mouse to the center of the stack exhaust exit.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Record the minutes for both latitude and longitude of the stack for some later number crunching.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Of course, because we are looking down on the stack from above but at an angle, not straight down the stack hole, the number you record is not the actual location of this stack, but that is not our objective in this exercise.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Any reading 30 or more seconds is rounded to the next minute of reading, ie. N44*16’30” gives 17 for the minutes value and adding the two digits (1+7) gives 8.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; N44*16’29.9” gives 16 minutes or a sum of 7.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Got it, OK!&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">What an adventure this was!  Both of us "Google Earthed" the stacks (what an eye opener that was) then compared notes.  Pretty darn close on coordintes but still needed a nudge from the CO.  First waypoint in hand, we set off on this cool morning to see how far we'd get.  Surprisingly, the waypoints were fairly close together and we found ourselves in somewhat familiar territory.  Found the waypoints fairly quickly but the final was a bit more of a challenge.  After reading every log and searching every crack mid way down the face, we ended up phoning a "friend",  rewalking the top and finding the skinny path to the cache!  Yeah!  Beautiful spot!  Really appreciated the CO's cooperative spirit with this one!</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We have been steadily working on our qualifications for both the WA Fizzy and the Original Fizzy Challenge in California.  We finished up the WA Fizzy a few weeks ago, but were still two caches short for the Original Fizzy, which requires all caches to be published prior to April 2007.  There is not a cache with this Diff/Terr combo in Washington that is old enough to qualify.  So...off we went to Bend for this cache.  

Any time you travel this far for a single cache, you feel a certain amount of pressure to find it.  I solved the puzzle at home (it was lots of fun to see all the big stacks) and we really lucked out on WP1 and WP2.  The final however gave us fits!  We tried the low approach first and wished we had checked out the high approach instead.  Eventually, we spotted the right place to squeeze in.  The cache is in great shape and had lots of cool swag.  We stamped the log and left a pathtag for the next finders.

Thanks so much for placing and maintaining this great cache.  We love the care that was taken with each step and the fun journey we experienced.  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

I attempted to sit at the lunchtable as well, but I'm not usually the type of biker to do so, so naturally I nearly fell off. Thanks for getting me out here!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This one is stashed up high in the rocks near a fun little place to go for a day of rock climbing.  Mostly bouldering, but you could do a little top rope, too.  You don't need to be a climber to find the cache though, but if you are, you might find it a little more fun to come up from the bottom.  If you're not, then come find it from the top.  It is only about 300 feet more to walk around to the top of the bluff.  You can even use the road with the Forest Service gate on it to make it really easy.  The cache is on the edge though, so be a little careful.  I did hide it with a dog in tow and on a leash, so its not to hard and I did the climb as well in my hiking shoes, so it's not exactly expert level either.

If you are a climber and want to see more rock faces, set your next Geocache to be Cache On Delivery (N 44*00.562, W 121*24.124) and follow the bluff until you get there.  The Wedgi Creek Bouldering site runs for about 300 feet. Then, if you keep following the bluff, there are several other smaller faces you can climb as well.</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>About twenty feet from the bottom or five feet from the top.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

No trees were killed to send this message, but a large number of electrons were terribly inconvenienced.

Oh freddled gruntbuggly,
Thy micturitions are to me,
As plurdled gabbleblotchits,
On a lurgid bee,
That mordiously hath blurted out,
Its earted jurtles,
Into a rancid festering confectious organ squealer. [drowned out by moaning and screaming]
Now the jurpling slayjid agrocrustles,
Are slurping hagrilly up the axlegrurts,
And living glupules frart and slipulate,
Like jowling meated liverslime,
Groop, I implore thee, my foonting turling dromes,
And hooptiously drangle me,
With crinkly bindlewurdles,
Or else I shall rend thee in the gobberwarts with my blurglecruncheon,
See if I don't.

First childhood, no limits, no renunciations, 
no goals. Such unthinking joy.
Then abrupt terror, schoolrooms, boundaries, captivity, 
and a plunge into temptation and deep loss.
Defiance. The one crushed will be the crusher now, 
and he avenges his defeats on others.
Loved, feared, he rescues, wrestles, wins, 
and overpowers others, slowly, act by act.
And then all alone in space, in lightness, in cold.
But deep in the shape he has made to stand erect
he takes a breath, as if reaching for the First, Primitive . . .
Then God explodes from his hiding place.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Cache is located inside a hollowed down log but easy to find.  In a first aid metal container painted brown.  Make sure you unlatch all latches to get inside.  Five dollars for first finder.  Sundry bicycle parts items, such as, pedals,and it would be nice to put those type of items in but not mandatory.  Located close to a junction in the trail system so it would be nice to start at Phil's trail head and bike in.  Trails to there are not difficult and is pretty much in the center of the whole system so nice place to take a break.  Be sure to look for the other caches in this trail system as well.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Compression Station #12: GTN Sunriver</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">These compressor stations are spaced about 50-60 miles apart along the GTN transmission pipeline, from the Canadian gas field source to the final distribution in Southern California.  Line pressures can be adjusted to control the velocity of the gas in the pipeline.  

Typical line velocity is 30 miles per hour and gas can be "parked" in segments of the pipeline to adjust for demand.  The gas in a segment of pipe between two compression stations is called a "linepack" and can be adjusted in velocity remotely to account for fluctuations in demand.  Line pressures range from 200 PSI to 1,500 PSI, with the steel transmission pipes ranging 20-42 inches in diameter.

Jet engines are used to compress the gas, using bleed gas as fuel for the jet.  A similar station (#11) is located alongside Hwy 26, east of Pine Ridge.  Some stations have small landing strips for servicing the station. Both this station and #11 have such landing strips for STOL aircraft.



The ladder-like array in the center of this complex is likely a heat-exchanger, designed to extract heat from the gas once it is compressed.  The plastic tubs in the service yard are for storage of the oil used in the compression process.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Today I was trying to locate some lonely caches.  I drove to the bottom of the butte and went as far as I was comfortable before starting out on foot.  The bottom portion had lots of downed trees.  Midway up I located some deer trails and used those to make my way to the top.  At the GZ, I searched a bit and finally located the cache on the ground.  The lid was cracked and it looked like something had chewed on the container.  I signed my name and placed the cache back to match the hint.  I made it most of the way down the butte when I heard thunder.  Luckily I got back to the car before the storm arrived, but it prevented me from attempting Kapka butte.</groundspeak:text>

My guess would be sasquatch.  Probably a huge, hairy one --- with an attitude.  Could this be why no-one has logged a find in over a year???  Could it be that they've been eaten???  Is anyone out there missing a caching buddy???  Oh well, not me.  I kept a keen eye out on the way down though.  TNLN  TFTH

A little known landmark on the west side of town. Who know's why,
and better yet, why here? But the end result is a fantastic view of
more than just Thom's family!

&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATED 4/16/06 TO A PROJECTION CACHE WITH A NEW
CONTAINER PLACEMENT!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
A fairly short projection cache ending up on a ledge with a
fantastic view looking east. There is a little climbing &amp;amp;
bushwacking involved, but not bad. After all, we sure would not
want to scuff up members of the family tree. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
From the above location, which should be rather obvious once you
get there, your mission is to project a waypoint of 515 feet at 321
degrees magnetic. There are a couple ways to do this, one being a
straight forward projection. The other would be a reverse direction
in which you would walk until your gps said 515 feet at 141 degrees
magnetic. That would be the bearing and distance back to Thom's
family from the actual cache location.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Watch the little one's, the first step
off the ledge is a big one.&lt;br&gt;
 The fall would not be that bad, but the stop at the bottom would
really hurt!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Found it right at sunset and it was beautiful!  Had a little trouble figuring out how to calculate the correct projection but managed just fine.  I figured out that I had adjusted toward west and not east but didn't feel like doing the projection again so I just estimated the same distance in the opposite direction and figured it out from there.  Isn't it kinda funny when your intuition kicks in and you just know you're in the right spot? Like somehow that last spot on the cliff with nearly the same view could have been it, but no it just didn't feel right.  But this spot... this makes sense. Anyway, thanks for the cache!  As others have said the log is pretty wet and the cache itself is a bit rusty and isn't sealing very well.  Might be a good idea to give it a new container and/or baggie before winter.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This cache has been on our radar for a long time and we finally made the trek today. Slow took his compass to do the projection and got us to the top of the cliff. We looked around in several likely places but didn't find the cache so I looked through the settings on my GPS to figure out how to change it for what was needed and soon had us at the reverse projection listed we found the cache. Unfortunately, it was quite wet inside. We dried out the cache container and let the treasure and log sit in the sun while we watched bikers on the trail below. We read through the log book while drying off the pages but we couldn't stay long enough for it to completely dry. It's just slightly damp. We left the treasure that we were able to dry off but there were 3 items that were completely saturated and not something I could dry on my shirt tail so we took them out. We also retrieved the 2006-California Geocoin (copy) and are drying it out at home before sending it on it's journey.

Lonely cache, cache maintenance, good hike up the cliff and good view. What more can you ask for? We enjoyed it. Definitely left the cache hounds at home for this one. Thanks for the find and the opportunity to learn something different on my GPS. We gave it a favorite point.

Current contents of cache - 3 tubes of beads, plastic coin, plastic bug, and a blow up ball/balloon thingie all dry at this time, a very slightly damp log, pencil, pencil sharpener, 2 pens that actually work.</groundspeak:text>

Reflecting back, I recall finding the original Billiam's cache. I recall going in circles before spotting it. Also remember it was hard to put back. I just do not recall exactly what it looked like. When I return I must be more patient.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This parking area is usually a pit stop for RV travelers on their way out of town, Thought this would be a good location for a travel bugs hitching a ride south.  GPS was pretty jumpy, averaged 5 readings to come up with Coords but should be a fairly easy grab for most even without the hint... Amongst the bounty I included the first guest tenant TB (no name tb), lots of goodies for the kids as well.  Small to medium Stainless container, log, pen, No name TB and standard bounty.  Will update goodies now and then   Shout out to ganz genau and GPS51111 tag teaming the FTF :-)&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache is a survivor of our recent trip to southern Nevada. We spent a day doing a series of caches along Walking Box Ranch Road that had a cache for all the states, all their capitals, some of the outlying islands and even the State of Jefferson and both of it's proposed capitals. This container was taken and replaced by us as it was missing the lid. Decided to bring it home and got a replacement lid and now it is happily being used again. You see many of this type of container in the deserts of Nevada. 

Started the cache with a couple of TB. Room for small items only. Happy Caching.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;Find the old road into the Deschutes National Forest's smallest cinder pit. Don't let size fool you, still a lot to see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;div style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:13px;"&gt;Description:
&lt;div&gt;A series of caches located at USFS mineral resource pits, within the Deschutes National Forest. These pits are listed and named in the Bend District Materials Sources Land Management Plan as a mineral resource. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;A tribute to building our forest road system, these quarries remain as a historic reminder of a time gone by. While some are still in production, many of these are located in very scenic spots throughout forest, but are not currently maintained. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The intent of this series is to find the “lost quarries” that have been abandoned, and are in the process of being reclaimed by mother nature. A short hike will be required thru the quarries to find the caches.  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;We suggest parking at the end of the road and going for a walk!  Driving into these areas may result in damage to the area and/or your rig. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;With over 160 official quarries and pits, located in remote locations throughout the forest, look for future lost quarry caches to come!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:13px;"&gt;Happy caching.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:13px;"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

Today Ferd was reminded of GEO caching rule #1…
Rule #1 always bring extra batteries
Rule #2 always make sure you have batteries in GPS
In case of Rule #2 see Rule #1
Rule #3 have a cell phone incase you forget Rule #1 and Rule #2.
Rule #4 bring your wife, all is well.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Day 24: woke up and saw there was a new cache and went back to bed. When I got up and ready saw it still wasn't found. I proceeded to the area walked .25 mile and about 300 feet away was 2 people and horses. I was literally beat by mins lol maybe if I hadn't forgot my iPhone/GPS I would have been FTF lol. I left the dog leashes in the truck of coarse because I didn't think we would run into anyone lol lucky the dogs did good with the horses lol. We yak'd for a few and parted ways, even though I didn't get the FTF it was nice meeting some geocachers from the area.... Thanks for the cache </groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">This cache is located in the Sugarpine Butte area. This cache
involves driving a number of low standard roads so a vehicle with
high clearance is advisable and if you want to drive as far as
possible a 4x4 would be helpful. There is some walking for short
distances on young lava flows so wear sturdy hard soled shoes.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The first point is located at N 43° 49.634’, W 121° 22.395’ and you
are looking for a 3”x2”x1/2” metal tin with instructions inside.
The tin is in a tree mold on the North Sugarpine lava flow. This
flow vented from fissure vents which cut the flank of the much
older Sugarpine Butte. Depending on the route you choose you may
pass these vents on your way to the second point. This flow is a
pahoehoe flow and is quite thin and contains many tree molds. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The actual cache (ammo can) is located on the South Sugarpine lava
flow which was erupted from an unnamed butte south of Sugarpine
Butte. This flow in contrast to the North Sugarpine flow is what is
known as an aa flow and is much thicker. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Both of these flows were erupted from the NW Rift zone of Newberry
Volcano about 7000 years ago. The early part of the eruption was
gas rich resulting in spatter ramparts along fissures and pahoehoe
flows. After the gas rich magma was erupted the eruptive style
changed and a cinder cone and thick aa flow was erupted. From the
cache site there is a good view of the summit area of Newberry
Volcano to the south. The volcano actually extends northward almost
to Bend.</groundspeak:long_description>

The first waypoint was tricky, we had left the clue in the car so were winging it. Finally found not one, but two Altoids tins, stacked on top of each other. Oh well, off to find the next waypoint. 

We followed the previous finder's advice about which road to take and were soon driving on a fabulous lava road and then hiking through a gorgeous park-like area and back onto the flow. After making the find and snapping some pix, we checked our maps and figured we were very close to Highway 97 via Forest Road 9725, and decided to take that way out....but were blocked by a fallen tree (see photo).

We tried all our tricks to move it out of the way but it was a green tree and so weighed a ton. No go. Back all the way around to the original road in to Sugarpine Butte. 

What a great adventure, we loved this cache. Uber-favorite!</groundspeak:text>

A little bit of blood the second time. First time I was there, I was walking all over it. I just didn't look in quite the right location. I wasn't going to give up so easy though, came back and got it this time! Grabbing this one as part of the Geocaching Road Trip '15, looking for a cache with 10+ favorite points. Thanks for the adventure! Found a few new biking and walking trails while caching out there.</groundspeak:text>

This can be a long or short hike, depending upon how far your rig will go along the dirt road.  We made it a nice 1.5 mi round trip by parking at the dirt bike lot.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">A mildly adventurous multi with great views awaits you. You need to find one waypoint, then the cache.  There's enough information included here to give you a reasonable chance of success. It's an ammo can. You're a geocacher. You'll figure it out.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Part I.
You pass a four-way junction, then 
Ascend the switchbacks three.
Below the big, atop the small,
Is where you want to be.

Part II.
The ease with which you travel hangs 
Upon the route you stride.
But "up or down?" is a question
Only searching can decide.

Our Garmin Oregon 450T measured  N44° 1.210 W121° 22.167, elevation 1185 meters (3887.8 feet) after 11 minutes of averaging, which is how long it took us to find the benchmark, find the cache, and return to the GPS. Cache is still there, but the instructions are a little misleading. When we couldn't find a tree with a cache, we started looking at things smaller than a tree and bigger than a tuft of grass. Eventually we found it. Should also mention that this is more of a 2/2 cache than a 1/1. TFTH.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Sitka's Cache is named after our sweet Siberian Husky girl that passed this year and placed in the area around our home where she loved to run. If you live locally in the area you may have even met her as she was a fence jumping, hole digging, escape artist for all of her 11 years of life! She loved chasing squirrels, rabbits, and unfortunately porcupines (which never worked out well for her). When she would finally tire out she would find a neighbor and plant herself in their yard or just sit out in the woods behind our house and howl for us to come find her! We called it her "wookie cry", not quite a howl and definitely not a bark with a little hint of a 'purr' at the end. We love her and miss her dearly and hope that this cache will bring a smile to the faces of owners of past and present mischevious dogs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We started the cache out with fun toys and accessories for your dog in honor of our Sitka. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Parking: this is a quick stop and easy grab with a large gravel parking lot located right next to the cache on the "cross street".&lt;br /&gt;
Gift card for FTF.&lt;br /&gt;
Enjoy! Congrats MK RHINO on FTF!

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Great multi, us and the dogs had a great time making this find today.  The manzanita is building a very natural fence around this one and may not be very accessible for many more years.  But the cache and all the waypoints are in excellent condition and the coords are spot on.  One very curious detail though, we were only the second to sign the log ... right behind Markellie, the FTF.  This leads me to believe that others have maybe made the same mistake that we almost made.  When we found the third hide it was marked "Final" with some coords.  At first we thought that we had just found the final but then realized that the coords were different than those that we had just gotten from the second waypoint to find this location.  So we headed off to those new coords and found what wasn't so camouflaged ... a bright orange container with a log and trinkets to trade.  Soooo ... moral to the story is that there's four parts to this one, not just three.  Thanks for the hide, most definitely get a fav point form us.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A multi stage cache in the Mokst butte lava flow within the
Newberry National Volcanic Monument. This is some very difficult
terrain [entirely loose pumice like lava rock] . Not recommended
for young children, dogs or klutzy people without a first aid kit..
There are some amazing contorted Ponderosa pines in this area. Four
of the waypoints take you past some of the more interesting ones
I've found, there's more if you feel like looking around. Round
trip distance is about 2.3 miles, half of it on lava. Allow about
three hours for this one. Hiking in this terrain calls for good
boots and concentration. Park near the coordinates listed above and
find the first engraved copper tag with cords for the first tree.
Note: there are 5 tags total.. The last tag provides coordinates
that takes you to a kipuka [island] in the lava and the cache; an
ammo can with some better than average booty in it. I've limited
this geocache to premium members because the featured trees are
rare, fragile and irreplaceable, please respect them. Very few
people have ever seen them. I thought this would be a good way to
share one of my favorite out of the way spots.&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>1st tag:  stumped?
Tags are near the featured trees.
From the cache go north to  woods or NE to the main rd. for  easier hike back to your rig..</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

After discussing with owner, determined that we can't count as we thought we had found all the tags, which was not the case. Went back to where we quit and found the tag rather quickly and moved on to the final. Really enjoyed the discussion of why the trees go through such contortions. TFTH.

However, the roads were really slick up there so we headed over to give this one a shot. Spent about two hours hiking in and around the lava but failed to make the find at the final coordinates. Am sending email to make sure we got them down correctly as we didn't want to have to hike back the 1/2 mile to double check. </groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Tried to get this one last year before the snow fell but I was too late. Had to wait half a year to get-er-done. Looks like the first waypoint just peeked out a couple of weeks ago. Still some snow patches in the lava field. While scrambling from place to place I came up some pet names for the twisted ones. In order, fat boy, boa-constrictor, the roller, and the protector. Since it was slow going I had too much time to think. All the lava towers were just as interesting as the trees. Some big-ole-chimney's. The cache site was a nice restful place to take some time and sign the log book while rubbing the feet. Also learned something new from the extra info provided inside the logbook. Started stumbling near the end when I saw the flat dirt. Just remember to keep it slow and steady.  Thanks for this "off the beaten path" cache. Loved the challenge.

If you are doing the "Kawhop" cache while your out this way, I would do it second. That way you can get a view of where you hiked while doing this cache.</groundspeak:text>

This was one of the more economical places to play back in the day but alas it is gone. I have fond memories of this aggrevating game played on this old course. Times have changed, and I now refer to Bend as: Northern Palm Springs, (minus the heat). One WP &amp;amp; then the final.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The area is now frequented by personable dog walkers, come out and enjoy. Second half of numbers for the bonus in the area can be found under the lid, get them.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Well, I was out for a drive hunting caches and I remembered a nice
little spot for your entertainment.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Enjoy the area but be careful where you go and watch any children
and pets that you may bring with you. You should bring a light or
two just in case you want to explore more. And you just might want
to. It is not going to be that easy for you but you will enjoy the
end result. 
&lt;p&gt;This is a multi stage hunt. You will be out of town in the
puckerbrush and trees and for the final leg, high clearance or four
wheel drive or shanks mare will be needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first stage will involve a hike. As I am bit on the lazy
side where possible, if I can not drive in, you won’t find a way in
either. The first place you need is the “Above” part of the title.
No matter where you park, you will need to go “Above”and look for
the tag. You will be looking for a copper tag with the cache
numbers on it. Hint is below. While here, I crossed a lot of
critter tracks so be on the watch for wildlife. Come in from the
right spot and the hike is longer but real easy and okay for
kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After finding the tag and getting the numbers, you will be
heading for the cache itself. This will be the “Below” part of the
title. The cache is not below but it is close to the “Below” part
of the cache title so think to yourself, what is close to below.
The hint’s for this cache are cryptic but they should do. Hey, I
know there is logging terminology involved but that's my life. Also
just to warn you, The cache container is very well hidden. And on
top of that, the cache container is VERY WELL HIDDEN. The cache
container is a 50 cal. ammo can. Disclaimer: "Cut and Paste" logs
will be deleted without warning. We retain all rights to this
cache. We can and will modify, adjust, tweak, disable or archive
this cache at any time without prior notice. Without prior notice
we can and will delete any log that does not conform to our intent
of this cache hunt . We will not be liable for any direct,
indirect, punitive, or consequential damages you may suffer from
hunting this cache. If you attempt this geocache hunt, you do so at
your own risk. Know your limits and do not attempt to exceed your
abilities.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Hint # 1 :  A hint for this one is where would men sit  in getting their hair cut.  This one is made from Pinus ponderosa.  

Hint # 2 :  You should be able to SNAG (Pinus ponderosa) this one easy.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Happened to pick up my Logscaler TB while in Seaside so decided to make the find on this cache so I could drop it off in one of your caches. Hiked .5 miles in 24 min. for first leg with 186 ft. accent. This stage is still in great shape. Hiked .28 miles in 13 min. for the final stage as the first leg of an 8.1 mile hike on the Edison Nordic trails while doing two other caches (Rigley and AC/DC) in the area. The last stage is in great shape, but hadn't been hidden very well by the prior finder. Tried to make it a lot better hide as described in the description. TFTH.

I increased the difficulty to 2.5 because of the amount of traffic in the area. There is room for very small swag....... Unfortunately I was fighting against the snow and in a hurry to get home, so I will go back and leave some little trinkets later. Have fun, be safe in the snow &amp;amp; I hope this helps you earn your smilie on these freezing cold, snowy days :)&lt;/p&gt;

This cache is located on the high point of the ridge running between Tumalo Valley and and the Swede Ridge trail system. Follow rd 4615 from the Virginia Meissner snow park just off the Cascade Lakes Highway. It joins rd 300 after a few miles which ends at an old cinder pit. Follow the trail up from there for a great view. Walk around and you could make it into a 360 degree view.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">There is a nice trail up the backside of the hill. No need to scramble up the loose stuff.

As long as your out here why not try the bike trail, explore some of the shelters or continue on the walking trail from the top. Fun, fun, fun.

Had lots of gps bounce at first and with so many places to look was wondering if I'd find it. Put the gps down for a few minutes to settle and then finally made the find with margin showing within 4'. I bushwacked in, but saw the trail after finding the cache and followed that out.

Because of its nearness to the trail, if you do find it, please conceal it carefully.  If, however, you fail miserably, feel free to ask for help.

This section of trail doesn't see as much use as others in the area, so you should have a reasonable amount of privacy for a good search. If you are biking to this, be aware that parts of this section are very technical.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to &lt;i&gt;The Lair&lt;/i&gt;, a 35-acre mountain bike park where
you--or your kids--can practice advanced bike handling skills. It
is designed with flowing trails of curves, jumps, steps, rocks,
drop-offs and wood ramps. More are planned. The trails start and
end in the open staging area. The park is a joint project of the
Central Oregon Trail Alliance and the Deschutes National Forest.
Many volunteers have contributed to the on-going effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is--what else--a bicycle water bottle. There is an
unactivated surfer geocoin for FTF. Take a breather, enjoy the
view, and on the way &lt;i&gt;DOWN&lt;/i&gt; stop to visit &lt;a rel="nofollow"

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Freeride:&lt;/b&gt; Freeride is a relatively new discipline of
mountain biking, combining different aspects of the sport such as
downhill, dirtjumping and trials. The term is a derivative of
freeriding, which originally came from snowboarding and is used in
other sports including skiing and windsurfing. The original concept
of freeriding was that there was no set course, goals or rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Getting there:&lt;/b&gt; Several bike trails lead to the park. If
you drive, there is a small parking area at the end of a narrow,
dirt road (see additional waypoints) from the north. A poor forest
road also connects with Century Drive from the south. The forest
roads are occasionally closed to motor vehicles. The Tetherow Golf
Resort Community is a quarter-mile to the east but discourages
parking on their streets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK1FDYY - Parking&lt;br /&gt;N 44° 01.573 W 121° 22.359&lt;br /&gt;Small parking area about 2 miles south of Skyliners Road.

Well I still managed to get it but I nearly froze one of my hands off and I’m sure it look longer because of the swoosh being covered in a dusting of snow. THANK YOU FOR THE PICTURE! If I hadn’t had that picture of the swoosh I don’t know what I would have done so that was a life saver! (man I’m using a lot of ! in this log…) well I was texting GPS51111 for help the whole time and that is really what froze my hand because touch screens and gloves only mix so well. Saw a biker riding the hills and having a blast. Got the cache with a burst of elation at finding it and at only slipping 3 times and none of them killed me [:D] glad I got this before real snow happened.

&lt;p&gt;I'll be nice with the first one though...no black wolves or arches and elbows.&lt;/p&gt;
Small cache with room for small trade items. Original contents include:
&lt;p&gt;Knife sharpener&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LoveJoy's bumper sticker (awesome store nearby)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 hand rolled CITO Blanko Especials&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">A new kid friendly geocache.  Ryder and his friends hid this on his 7th birthday.  The cache is in the Lair bike park area.  The terrain is very manageable for younger children although a portion of the hike is not on a trail.  The final approach is marked with a cool animal bone marking the spot.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is in the Lair bike area.  The cache is hidden in the rocks.  Please place the bone back for the next group.  The ammo box is filled with fun child friendly goodies.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Thanks for the cache. Everything was fine and dandy even after such a long period with no one finding this cache. Contents were still child friendly though the bone that was supposed to be adorning the rocks it was hidden under wasn’t there. Perhaps I saw it on the way up but I took a different path down so I didn't have a chance to move and replace it. I’d like to do more in this area but only after the car has gotten dirty and dusty again [:D]

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">You select your starting point, but I would recommend the Phil's trail head parking area located off of Forest Service Road 4604.  The coordinates listed above are for the waypoint.  You will need to locate the waypoint to collect some information.

When you reach the waypoint, you should see a small sign.  Record the two digit identification number from this sign.  Assume that the two digit number represents XX.

Alright, now for some quick math to find the final cache coordinates.

Final Coordinates = N 44° 0A.BBB W 121° CC.DDD

A = XX - 15
BBB = (XX * 21) + 2
CC = XX + 10
DDD = XX * 25

After locating this cache you might also try locating “Lunchtable” (GCG5YJ). When combined with this cache it will make a nice 10 mile loop back to the trail head.

Not only did he solve it from the couch- he "located" it as well. He decided to find it without a gps. First, we went past the first way point ( just to make sure) . Then, when we reached a certain spot, we got off our bikes and found it by walking a certain number of paces one way, turn, then another another way. THERE IT WAS ( well, we searched a tad). Incredible, geocaching from the couch!

Did this one as a traditional, more or less. Figured out the number from the first waypoint by using my mountain bike trail map. Found the cache quickly with good coords. Interesting container. Trails were very busy in this area today. t4tc</groundspeak:text>

The nordic trail starts at Swampy Lakes Snow Park and is 7 miles round trip.  It is considered an intermediate trail. Snow Park Permit is required during the ski season. By bike, the trail is accessible from several entry points including Swampy Lakes Snow Park.  Most trailheads require a Northwest Forest Pass.  If you bike in, please avoid coming when the trails are muddy after the spring thaw and leave your bike at the Swede Ridge Warming Shelter (see waypoint) and walk to the cache from there.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Tried to find this today.  Found the spot and the black rope, but the end of the rope was just above the snow level with nothing attached.  Dug about 12 - 18 inches down and hit dirt.  Hole was about 20 inches across.  Sadley, no find.  Dang! I wanted to be the first to ski in and find in a while.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We headed up to the shelter today and, since we had found the cache in 2006, decided to check on it because of the previous DNF. I could see the cord disappearing into the snow so I assume the cache is still there. Didn't have a shovel or spare gloves so didn't try to extract it. Beautiful, warm day with spring skiing conditions. We met many people on the trail including a group who spent the night camped near the shelter.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Did a night ski to Swede Ridge Shelter to admire the lunar eclipse and enjoy the night's longest year. On the way out, I asked my 3 friends to help me look for this cache. Figured it would be easy with 4 people looking, even at night, but no such luck. Really wanted to be the first winter find of this cache in four years. Looked in every thicket, but the trees were carrying a lot of snow and we didn't see any black cord. I'm sure it's still there, but sadly, I don't get out to this shelter too often. Sorry, Goudacat.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;We placed it out in the BLM in Woodside Ranch so it would be close to home. This is a well hid (covered up) old contanier wrapped in black duct tape. The easiest and more direct way to drive through Woodside Ranch, then there is an opening on Ridgeview Road to get to the small path. Don't worry, this is PUBLIC property, but you will spot some houses on the other side of the fence!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember to seal cache tight and try to put it back exactly how you found it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Keep in mind you will have about a half of mile hike to this location because the path is too small for cars.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This is the 2nd page for this cache! The first one was archieved because the coords were off! Sorry)&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;I was looking through an old geology book and this excerpt reminded me of the interesting lava near Luna Butte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Student’s Elements of Geology (1871), by Sir Charles Lyell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In regions where the eruption of volcanic matter has taken place in the open air, and where the surace has never since been subjected to great aqueous denudation, cones and craters constitute the most strking peculiarity of this class of formations. Many hundreds of these cones are seen in central France, in the ancient provinces of Auvergne, Velay, and Vivarais, where they observe, for the most part, a linear arrangement, and orm chains of hills. Although none of the eruptions have happened within the hisorical era, the streams of lava ma still be traced distinctly descending from many of the craters, and ollowing the lowest levels of the existing valleys. The origin of the cne and crater- shaped hill is well nderstood, the growth of many having been watched during volcanic eruptions. A chasm or fissure first opens in the eath, from which great volumes of steam are evolved. The explosions are so violent as to hurl up into the air ragments of broken stone, parts of which are shivered into minute atoms. At the same time melted stone or lava usually ascends thrugh the chimney or vent by which the gases make their escape. Although extremely heavy, this lava is forced up by the expansive power of entangled gaseous flids, chiefly steam or aqueous vapour, exactly in the same manner as water is made to boil ove the edge of a vessel when steam has been generated at the bottom by heat. Large quantities of the lava are also shot up into the air, where it separates into fragmens, and acquires a spongy texture by the sudden enlargement of the included gases, and thus forms scoriae, other portions being reduced to an impalpable powder or dust. The showering down of the various ejected materials round the orifice of eruption gives rise to a conical mound, in which the successive envelopes of sand and scoriae form layers, dipping on all sides from a central axis. In the meantime a ollow, called a crater, has been kept open in the middle of the mound by the continued passage upward of steam and othe gaseous fluids. The lava sometimes flows ovr the edge of the crater, and thus thickens and strengthens the sids of the cone; but sometimes it breaks down the cone on one side (see Figure 585), and often it flows out from a issure at the base of the hill, or at some distance from its base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sme geologists had erroneously spposed, from observations made on recent cones of eruption, that lava which consolidates on steep slopes is always of a scoriaceous or vesicular structure, and neve of that compact texture which we find in those rocks which are usually termed "trappean." Misled by thi theory, they have gone so far as to believe that if melted matter has originally descended a slope at an angle exceeding four or fve degrees, it never, on cooling, acquires a stony compact teture. Consequenly, whenever they found in a volcanic mountain sheets of stony materials inclined at angles of from 5 degrees to 20 degres or even more than 30 degrees, they thought themselves warranted in assuming that such rocks had been originally horizontal, or very slightly inclined, and had acquired their high inclination by subsequent upheaval. To such dome-shaped mountains with a cavity in the middl, and with the inclined beds having what was called a quaquaversal dip or a slope outward on all sides, they gave the name of "Elevatio craters."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the late Leopold Von Buch, the author of this thery, had selected the Isle of Palma, one of the Canaries, as a typical illustratio of this form of volcanic mountain, I visited that island in 1854, in company with my friend Mr. Hartung, and I satisfied myself that it owes its origin to a series of ruptions of the same nature as those which formed the minor cones, already alluded to. In some of the more acient or Miocene volcanic mountains, such as Mont Dor and Cantal in central France, the mode of origin by upheaval as above described is attributed to those dome-shaped masses, whether they possess or not a great central cavity, as in Palma. Where this cavity is present, it has probably been due to one or more great explosions similar to that whch destroyed a great part of ancient Vesuvius in the time of Pliny. Similar paroxysmal catastrophes have caused in historical times the truncation o a grand scale of some large cones in Java and elsewhere. (Principles volume 2 pages 56 and 145.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among th objections which may be considered as fatal to Von Buch's doctrine of upheaval in these cases, I may state that a series of volcanic formations exteding over an area sx or seven miles in its shortest diameter, as in Palma, could not be accumulated in the form of lavas, tuffs, and volcanic breccias or agglomerates without producing a mountai as lofty as that which they now constitute. But assuming that they were first horizontal, and then lifted up by a force acting most powerfully in the centre and tilting the beds on all sides, a central crater having been formed by xplosion or by a chasm opening in the middle, where the continuity of the rocks was interrupted, we should have a right to expect that the chief ravines or valleys would open towards the central cavity, instead of which the rim of the great crater in Palma and other similar ancient volcanoes is entire for more than three parts of the whole circumference.&lt;/p&gt;

GPS51111 and I had a blast today caching, plus we rescued a travel bug from obscurity up here. Besides she’s obsessed with climbing all the weird little buttes out here that I didn’t know had names or reasons to have names. Well it makes for solid adventure [:D] had a crazy variety of things to hike through, from thick forest to lava rock and on the way back nice dirt road with an ice covering [:P]

Found the cache without any difficulty and everything was in great condition. Almost wished you’d used a bigger container so you could have categorized it as large [:P]

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Went on a chilly walk to find this cache as the wind was blowing hard even amongst trees. Fun find though and not too many people in the area.

No trees were killed to send this message, but a large number of electrons were terribly inconvenienced.

Oh freddled gruntbuggly,
Thy micturitions are to me,
As plurdled gabbleblotchits,
On a lurgid bee,
That mordiously hath blurted out,
Its earted jurtles,
Into a rancid festering confectious organ squealer. [drowned out by moaning and screaming]
Now the jurpling slayjid agrocrustles,
Are slurping hagrilly up the axlegrurts,
And living glupules frart and slipulate,
Like jowling meated liverslime,
Groop, I implore thee, my foonting turling dromes,
And hooptiously drangle me,
With crinkly bindlewurdles,
Or else I shall rend thee in the gobberwarts with my blurglecruncheon,
See if I don't.

First childhood, no limits, no renunciations, 
no goals. Such unthinking joy.
Then abrupt terror, schoolrooms, boundaries, captivity, 
and a plunge into temptation and deep loss.
Defiance. The one crushed will be the crusher now, 
and he avenges his defeats on others.
Loved, feared, he rescues, wrestles, wins, 
and overpowers others, slowly, act by act.
And then all alone in space, in lightness, in cold.
But deep in the shape he has made to stand erect
he takes a breath, as if reaching for the First, Primitive . . .
Then God explodes from his hiding place.

We parked near the OMSI camp.  As you hike/bike or maybe xc ski this one you will come across the Virginia Meissner snow park trail follow it.  These caches will not be too far off the trail.  

The listed coords. will take you to the first cache.  You are looking for a small plastic container.  Inside you will find the coords. to a ammo container.  When you find that cache remember to write down the bonus coords.

We placed this ammo cache and the bonus one in areas close to wonderful views, so take a moment and enjoy.  On your way up please take a moment to stop at N44' 01.818 and     W 121' 31.701 to take it in.

Each stage was done in the evening after dinner so we did not have much time.  Not far from our cabin but it has been years since I hiked the trail.  It is good to get out.  Note first cache was wet.  I will pick it up some day and dry out before winter snows fall. 

keep cranking out local caches as I have time

Quite a forest of manzanita up in these parts. Almost big enough to build a treehouse in. Made the quick found once I got myself to ground zero. Now off to the bonus.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache is a well hid micro.  The Mrs. begged to put the cache here.  The graffiti at each end reminded her of home in NY.

30 Jan 08: The original hint referred to graffiti that has since been painted over, so I've revised the hint.

21 Aug 08: I replaced the missing film can with a container that should keep it out of sight. Please keep that in mind when replacing it.

10 Dec 08: There has been some concern about this location being private property. It might be a private 'right of way' within public property, but is definately not private property. They are probably testy from having to paint over grafitti a couple times a year. So I guess if we are going to be able to keep this cache here, we need to avoid drawing attention to it by seeking it only while there are no people around.

1 Jan 14: New container in place for the new year!</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">For the last few years I’ve been volunteering with the U.S. Geological Survey as a field assistant to help with the mapping of Newberry Volcano.  This week I was working in the Sugarpine Butte area and one of my tasks involved a hike to the summit of the vent for the South Sugarpine flow. 

This unnamed cone is at the southeast end of a mile long fissure and is the major vent along the fissure producing the South Sugarpine flow.  Three additional vent areas occur to the northwest and combined produced the much smaller North Sugarpine flow. These flows are part of the Northwest Rift Zone eruption 7000 years ago.

The given coordinates take you to the summit where you will find a sign naming this unnamed butte. 
For the letters on the sign use the following letter equivalents: 
A=1
B=2
C=3
D=4
Etc.

N 43° 49.0XX’
XX = Multiply (Sign’s third letter equivalent) by 3 

W 121° 21.0ZZ’
ZZ = Multiply (Sign’s first letter equivalent) by 8.2

Check sum  XX+ZZ = 124

The cache is a screw cap plastic container. The name on the cache reflects the name you found at the summit, I decided to make it a multi-stage cache after I placed the container.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Should have parked at the ATV track that heads up towards the butte, but silly us thought driving up the road farther to the east would put us on a ridge and easy walk.  Wrong!!  Two ascents and descents later, we were making our way up the steep South Sugarpine slope that was heavily eroded by dirt bikes in hill climbs.  The subsoil is beginning to erode and form trenches from the recent rains coursing down the ruts.  Located the sign and immediately understood the significance.  This is indeed a hardy sign, with plenty of nuts securing the several bolts.

Completed the math calculations and stumbled our way on over to the cache.  The lava below and narrative from the owner were both very interesting.  Rather than climb back up the hill, we contoured back to the base and made our way back to the rig, parked a half mile farther up the hill than it really needed to be.  Thanks for the geology lesson and the fun. Bailey and BC</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Towards the west end of the rugged, hiker-only Tumalo Creek Trail
upstream of Shevlin Park. One of three wildflower caches along the
creek and about a mile west of Penstemon, GC1V4NP.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;img src=

align="right" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Indian Paintbrush, aka Prairie-Fire: a large group of
parasitic plants found throughout the Americas from sea level to
alpine regions. Often bright red but can vary from orange to
scarlet to purple to even white or yellow. Their color comes from
dense, bright bracts that surround the actual flower. The flowers
can be used as a condiment and have health benefit similar to
garlic.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is at an interesting trail feature and is close to the
only side road (4WD) that crosses the 4-mile trail. This section of
the trail is relatively flat and close to the creek for roughly a
half-mile in either direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you choose to drive to the cache, do yourself a favor and
walk part of the trail to get a feel for this tumultuous section of
the creek lined by lilies and other wildflowers. Better yet, hike
down from the upper (western) trailhead near the old Columbia Canal
(now dry). If you have two vehicles it would be possible to leave
one at the lower trailhead for Penstemon and hike the entire 4
miles--which feels more like 7 miles. Some parts of the trail are
unsuitable for kids and dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a decon container about 20 feet east of the
trail feature. You will have to move a small, flat rock to see
it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;TH1VJKM - Upper trailhead&lt;br /&gt;N 44° 02.633 W 121° 28.051&lt;br /&gt;Trailhead near western end of Tumalo Creek Trail with room for a couple of cars. Reached from Jack Pine Spring Road.&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Thought for sure since owner logged that it was still in place that we would find.  GPS bounced a lot which didn't help and not sure if we fully understood the hint and the last line in the description. After a lot of looking and rock turning, had to give up. Cool spot for a cache.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Penstemon, aka Beard Tongue: a large group of plants in the
Plantaginaceae family with opposite leaves, two-lipped, variously
colored corolla, and capsules containing many seeds. Can be a few
inches to several feet high. Found across North America in habitats
ranging from open desert to moist forests and up to the alpine
zone, but uncommon within their range.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trail is steep and narrow with some boulder scrambling,
unsuitable for most kids and dogs. It begins from the old Brooks
haul road (gravel Forest Road 4606) and passes interesting cliffs,
wildflowers, and old growth pines and firs. Tumalo Creek passes
tantalizingly in and out of view below, but always within
earshot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several varieties of Penstemon line the trail and are prominent
around the cache site in spring and early summer. The cache is in a
rock wall about 10 feet west of the trail and 4 feet above. Should
be an easy find except the cliffs play havoc with satellite
reception; the west decimal minutes were bouncing around from .909
to .922 for me. You are looking for a round 4-inch metal can known
as a German Army Butter Container.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;TH1V4NP - Trailhead&lt;br /&gt;N 44° 03.109 W 121° 24.719&lt;br /&gt;Trailhead on Forest Road 4606 with parking for a few cars. To reach trailhead turn onto 4606 at about MP 3.7 on Skyliners Road.&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Sparky and I were out today to complete the nearby puzzle caches and I wanted to add Luna Butte to my conquered butte hikes.  Once we were at the base of Luna we heard one loud but short thunderclap and had a relatively quick downpour of rain.  Knowing it would be Lunacy to ascend Luna Butte in a thunderstorm, I set off after the rain let up.  The beginning wasn't bad.  The Manzanita was about ankle high and the slope wasn't too bad.  I could see that it got steeper closer to the top however.  The rain stayed away and the manzanita got taller.  At one point, I hit the overlay of high pressure and immediately the temperature was at least ten degrees warmer and it was noticeably more humid.  It was a strange experience.  I fought my way through the now waist high manzanita and climbed over numerous blow-down trees.  Eventually, I made it to the top.  I always seem to make a 3.5 terrain cache a 5.  Its my gift.  The summit made it all worthwhile.  The views were amazing.  I immediately made my way to the cache and found it in excellent shape.  I made my mark on the log and did the check for unlogged travelers that might be in the cache and replaced the container.  I walked around the entire cone taking photos and then headed back to the truck.  I love that there are no trails to the top of this wonderful butte.  The views are always better when you have to earn them.  Thanks for the Smiley in a extraordinary place.

It now has a new container to replace the cracked one that was recently written about.  What a nice hike through the woods.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Welcome to Chloe's Butterfly Cache.  Chloe has been geocaching with us since she was 2 and she was ready to place her own.  We helped her design this cache to be beginner friendly.  Not too difficult to find and there is a nice meadow for a picnic.  Together we have caught and identified at least 9 different butterfly species in the meadow, so be sure to bring a net.  There are many grasshoppers and dragonflies too.  Pack along some bug spray as sometimes the mosquitoes come out to play with the butterflies.  Chloe and her little sister love to wade in the stream and look at the shiny rocks.  The cache is just a short way into the wooded area and there are nice paths along the river.  There are some other geocaches nearby if you are wanting to take on more caches while you are out.</groundspeak:long_description>

We thought we would stop for a few more before we head home and saw this group of caches that looked like fun. 

After grabbing the coordinates from the multi and the traditional, we headed straight for the final. This is definitely a nice area to get some exercise. We will have to come back and look for the other caches but for now, we accomplished out goal and found the 3 caches in this series. Our motivation was really based on the need to get a traditional, multi, and puzzle in the same day to qualify for a challenge (you actually need all 3 for 7 days in a row and this makes 6 days for us).

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Bates Butte is located southwest of Sunriver about 15 minutes and 10-15 minutes from the Fall River Fish Hatchery.  The terrain is a bit steep and consists of loose dirt/duff/gravel.  As you climb up Bates Butte, you will be ascending from about 4,170 feet elevation to about 4,780 feet elevation...an ascent of roughly 600 feet.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The Bates Butte Summit Cache is a microcache, so there is only a logbook to sign.  It is pretty well hidden...but please try to minimize the impact of looking for it.  Do look around at the great view!  It is well worth the climb.  Bates Butte can be a popular hike in the summer, so be stealthy as you find and rehide the cache so that it does not get stolen or moved by non-geocachers.

There is a good bit of bitterbrush that you will need to push through, but nothing too thick.  Because this cache is on the top of a peak it is inaccessible during winter due to snow, unless you want to dig through two or three feet of snow to get to the cache. 

From the top of Bates Butte, you can see Mount Batchelor and a couple of the Three Sisters to the West.  The Big Deschutes River wends lazily through the trees at the base of the Butte.  By the way, this butte was named for the Bates Ranch that used to be located in this area.

If you have trouble finding the cache...download the additional Waypoint and check the encrypted hints.  Have Fun!

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Out with Ferd Berfull grabbing some caches around Bessie Butte. This one was a toughie because we came on to the rocks from the north and wasted a lot of time looking around the top. We would have spotted it much sooner if we came on to the rocks from the south end and stayed in the middle.

I think the DT is way too low on this one. It takes some serious bushwacking to get close and then you have to do some rock crawling. The cache is more of a small than a regular which makes it even more difficult to find in all the rocks. Both of our GPS's  had  the coordinates about 20 feet northish of the actual cache site. 

It was a  nice hike through the woods and there was a beautiful view of Bessie Butte. Thanks for bringing us out here. TFTH</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">The upper cache in this series (#2 and #4 have been archived) is an ammo box located on the Mrazek Trail, a popular mountain bike route connecting Shevlin Park to Tumalo Falls and beyond.
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;img src="http://idisk.mac.com/main_street/Public/mtn-bike-friendly-art.jpg" align="right" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trail options:&lt;/b&gt; The cache can be reached by either the Mrazek Trail or by the hikers-only Tumalo Creek Trail. If walking, you can make this into an 8- to 11-mile round trip that combines both trails. It's possible to drive to near the cache but why would you want to do that and miss the best scenery?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Getting there:&lt;/b&gt; The trails can be reached from either Shevlin Park or from the old Brooks haul road (Forest Service Road 4612).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Shevlin Park, start at Fremont Meadow (N 44° 03.731' W 121° 23.763') and head upstream. You can stop by Cruise by the Creek 1 and several other caches on the way. Continue on the trail upstream along Tumalo Creek. The trail then switchbacks 200 feet up and out of the park. Near the top of the switchbacks at a signed trail junction, the Mrazek Trail goes right and the Tumalo Creek Trail takes off to the left; the trails meet again in several miles. Go right if on bicycle, or take either trail if on foot. This approach is longer than the option below but takes you through an especially nice area of Shevlin Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also intersect both trails on unpaved Forest Service Road 4612 above Shevlin Park. Drive out Skyliner Road a few miles past Mt. Washington Drive and take a right onto a gravel road at about MP 3.7. Take a left onto 4612 at the stop sign and go a couple miles to Tumalo Creek. A pullout and trailhead to the Tumalo Creek Trail (hikers only) is just across the bridge at N 44° 03.107' W 121° 24.721'. A little farther down the road you'll come cross the Tumalo Creek Trail again, then a side road, and finally the Mrazek Trail (N 44°03.568' W 121°24.613'). Park here and start pedaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache originally stocked with bicycling items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Further adventures:&lt;/b&gt; After the cache, you can return the way you came or, if hiking, take the other trail to make a loop out of it. If biking, you may want to continue up the Mrazek Trail father into the forest.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;h3&gt;The Moon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Latin word for Moon is Luna, so what better location than Luna Butte for a &lt;font color="blue"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moon-themed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt; cache? The Moon (or Luna) is the Earth’s only natural satellite (unlike Saturn which has more than 60 known moons). It was formed 4.6 billion years ago, likely by forces described in the Giant Impact hypothesis . . . astronomers think that a Mars-sized proto-planet violently collided with the Earth, creating a huge cloud of ejected debris which coalesced into the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To obtain the actual cache coordinates, you will need to solve the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;

Once over the bridge to Tumalo Falls continue to the right to get on road 4601. Follow it for a mile and a half and take a right at N 44 02.515 - W 121 29.979 down a dirt road. Keep right at the fork and continue down to the cache. I drove it in a passenger car.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This area once was part of the failed Tumalo Reservoir system. About one hundred years ago a series of canals were built to bring the flow of the creek into the reservoir. The Reservoir failed to hold water and the whole project was eventually abandoned.
 
This is a small piece of what is left of the grand plan.

 We used it as a wading dock to cool off in the hot summer sun.

Enjoy modern acheology.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The canyon of Tumalo Creek is one of my favorite places to wander, and its three-season accessibility makes it one of the first and last places I visit each season. We are truly lucky to have such a beautiful place to visit so close to town.

By the time you get to this cache, you will have spent a good amount of time in the area. This series was created to be done in one hike. Some trails are easy and flat, some are rough and steep. You'll visit quiet paths through ponderosa, shaded creekside glens, and sweeping vistas. But all of the caches are quite near a trail; cross-country travel might be tempting sometimes when you look where that arrow is pointing, but in places it would be difficult and dangerous. Each cache includes a clear description to get you to the next one. Happy hiking!

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Good Day,

It looks like your cache has been under the weather for some time. While I feel that Geocaching.com should hold the location for you and block other cachers from entering the area around this cache for a reasonable amount of time, we can't do so forever. Please either repair/replace this cache in the next couple of weeks, or archive it so that someone else can place a cache in the area, and cachers can once again enjoy visiting this location.

If the reason the cache is under the weather is something out of your control, such as construction or flooding, please post a note on the cache page with your best guess of when the conditions will improve. If the situation is temporary and is something out of your control, there is no need to archive the cache at this time.

I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to geocaching in the past and am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the future.

Thanks for your understanding - Cheers!

After signing the log, I gathered up my gumption and fought the manzanita to The Plug 2.  This container is also cracked on the bottom now, but nothing inside was damp despite the latest precipitation.  After making it back to the rig, where I had parked in an area where someone had been shooting.  I scavenged dozens of 9mm and .45 casings that I can make back into bullets.  A little bonus for me on this trip.  Thanks for the Smiley!!

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Helvetica;line-height:normal;"&gt;Description:
&lt;div&gt;A series of caches located at USFS mineral resource pits, within the Deschutes National Forest. These pits are listed and named in the Bend District Materials Sources Land Management Plan as a mineral resource. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;A tribute to building our forest road system, these quarries remain as a historic reminder of a time gone by. While some are still in production, many of these are located in very scenic spots throughout forest, but are not currently maintained. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The intent of this series is to find the “lost quarries” that have been abandoned, and are in the process of being reclaimed by mother nature. A short hike will be required thru the quarries to find the caches.  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;We suggest parking at the end of the road and going for a walk!  Driving into these areas may result in damage to the area and/or your rig. &lt;/div&gt;
A short hike though “North End Cinder Pit” &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Helvetica;line-height:normal;"&gt;Find your away above the pit for a great view on a clear day.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cache is named for the sidewalk-to-no-where that it's located near. Between a solid fence and a busy highway, this sidewalk starts and ends for no reason, maybe someday new construction will connect it to something, but for now it's used only by the deer (and now Geocachers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be able to get far enough off the road to park close by, but I recommend going into the neighborhood and parking near the only connecting path to the sidewalk located about 44.01424 -121.31846  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache was created and hidden by my family including my two young children, they love the sport and wanted to make our own. I hope you enjoy finding it as much as we enjoyed making it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fuel dispenser below must be from an unusual country because it displays a very odd Total Sale. If you examine the Sale amount closely you can derive 15 digits, which is good because those are the coordinates you need to find this cache:&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Good Day,

It looks like your cache has been under the weather for some time. While I feel that Geocaching.com should hold the location for you and block other cachers from entering the area around this cache for a reasonable amount of time, we can't do so forever. Please either repair/replace this cache in the next couple of weeks, or archive it so that someone else can place a cache in the area, and cachers can once again enjoy visiting this location.

If the reason the cache is under the weather is something out of your control, such as construction or flooding, please post a note on the cache page with your best guess of when the conditions will improve. If the situation is temporary and is something out of your control, there is no need to archive the cache at this time.

I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to geocaching in the past and am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the future.

Thanks for your understanding - Cheers!

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">After grabbing N.A.S. I had some time before a date at noon.  I set off to get this one logged.  I only saw one hiker and three cyclists total.  It was a fine day to grab these caches.  I arrived at the cache site after using trails much of the way and then bushwacking the last fifth of a mile.  I made it to the trail described in the cache description.  I looked and looked.  No hint listed, so I looked some more.  I then thought maybe the name of the cache was a clue in a way.  I looked and looked some more.  No luck.  A reminder text came in about my date at noon and I still had to hike out.  Now I was on a time limit.  I had to get this cache found.  Nearly ready to call it, I decided to check the logs and one struck me.  I think it was Slow that made a comment about using a rock in the bend of the trail to sit on.  I scrambled down to the obvious rock and quickly located the cache.  I had about 40' from my GPS zero point for the coordinates to the Southeast.  I used the same rock as Slow and did my homework.  I quickly re-hid the cache that had waited nearly a year for someone to find it and had to begin my extrication.  The last of the series would have to wait.  Thanks for this awesome series and as always a special Mystery Smiley!!

So don't forget your camera or smart phone. &lt;br /&gt;

There is parking along Knott Rd. but take the extra time to park in the neighborhood adjacent to the cache for safety.  Finally, get in touch with your inner Selleck!&lt;/div&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Smokey Friends have left another box of goodies at the location of a human caused fire.  Lava Butte Lookout detected this fire located approximately 4 miles southeast of the city limits of Bend, on the Deschutes National Forest, at 1:41 p.m. on July 23 2003. 
The 18 Fire burned in mixed conifer and sagebrush and burned about 3800 acres. 
The fire was contained on July 26.   

The first finder is welcome to the Beanie Smokey Bear!

A traditional cache where all you have to do is load one set of coordinates then go hike a short distance and find it.  It is even fairly close to town so you bike riders could ride to the starting point.  You are looking for a clear plastic nut jar (Costco) with a red lid.  Size is about a half a gallon.

Remember in college where classes were divided into lower division classes and upper division classes?  Our cache called "Manzanita" is a lower division class and should be a prerequisite for this one.  If you didn't like that one you for sure won't like this one.  Also, this one doesn't have hot pink flagging hanging like a christmas tree to help you locate the cache.

Have fun and take your time.  Wear long pants.  You will have some good views.  Might be a kitty cat in the area.  Can be done in about an hour.

Thank god I am a coastal forester and used to real brush.  The cache is located such as so it should survive the next Bridge Creek Burn.  We had dry lightning today while on the way to the cache.  I knew I was close when I found the empty Coors can.  I did pack it out.  Sorry for the next person who looks for the cache no more beer cans.  It was good to see the fuels reduction from the top the usfs has been doing the past two summers.  The fuels reductions should make the next Bridge Creek Fire easier to control.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Trying to get the required points for GC2R887 - DrAwKwArD's Only the Lonely Challenge cache hunt and sorting through the list for closest caches here in the local area, I found this lonely cache which has been sitting unfound for just shy of 4 years.

Nice cache placement there weenie.

I went in from the bottom  on the east side and then sidehilled up the North face until I was in the tree plantation and across the ridge to the cache.

It was a good day to be out in the tickets seeing as there is still plenty of snow/ice on top of the brush holding it all down so I only had to lop a few bush's to throw on top of the softer snow so as I would not have to posthole much.

It only took about 45 minutes to get to the cache, spent about 15 minutes at the cache and then about half an hour to go West on the road and then drop down through the brush back to the road and walk to the car.

I took nothing from the cache but I did leave a "Lost and Found" Traveler and some drink mix in the cache for the next finder.

I am not sure why this cache is so far and few between finds as it is really an easy location to get to in the summer when you can drive most of the way in or hiking even the road should take no more then an hour from the gravel.  Unless you come in from the Tumalo creek side and try to be foolish and go straight up the front. That would be dumb.

Thanks for a great hunt today.

I think this one score somewhere around 160 points for the challenge.

Another awesome thing to see that I may not have ever found otherwise.  The container is indeed cracked top and bottom but nothing was damp inside despite the damp weather lately.  The placement is good for preserving the cache I guess.  I wanted to bring duct tape for some cache maintenance points but like others before me, I forgot.  I parked in an area where someone had been shooting.  I scavenged dozens of 9mm and .45 casings that I can make back into bullets.  A little bonus for me on this trip.  Thanks for the Smiley!!

I have to confess we didn't realize this was a double until I had opened the bottle (hot day + soft glue + herculean strength = oops!) So then we figured out to use the coordinates for the second.

Managed to find a less traveled road (NF-490)and drove within .25 of first waypoint before deciding I had taken the 4X4 high-clearance (and now pen-striped)geomobile far enough. As I discovered walking down the road I probably could have driven to the first waypoint and about half-way to the cache had I chose to go further. This is not, however, a drive for your geomobile if you cherish your paint job as it will get "brushed"[:D]. Made quick work of the waypoint and hiked on down the old road to the final instead of bushwacking. Made for a little longer trip but an easier one as I was getting tired.

&lt;p&gt;Find Nesting in Bend [GC22K2P], and bring something to write with and on to get the new coordinates or plug them into your GPS and head out to find this nice little bonus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;We went to do maintenance on "Nesting in Bend" and bought a nice shiny new waterproof match holder to replace our little "baby".  When we went to replace it, the old one was fine but the log and bag needed maintenance so we thought it would be fun to make a bonus cache with the new shiny holder and add the coordinates into "Nesting in Bend".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To open the container you do not have to remove the wire...just start rotating the cylinder clockwise (to your left) and the canister will open at the end opposite the wire.  Bring your own writing implement and enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
This is supposed to be an easy cache. Look in the rocks. The cache cannot fall into any cracks due to its location. See hint if you need more information.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This traditional cache is followed by three bonus caches, which together are designed to guide you through a nice hike in the area of Tumalo Creek Canyon. I hiked 6.5 miles placing the series, but the final bonus describes a shorter way to return to your car.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">When you find this cache, you will find a guidebook. In the first couple of pages of the log, it will tell you how to use that guidebook to find the next cache in the series- and the first bonus- "N.A.S.". It will also describe the best route for you to follow in order to get to that cache. I strongly recommend following the suggested trails throughout this series. Straightline cross-country travel in most places would be extremely ill-advised. Expect mountain bikers, runners, etc., to be sharing some of these trails with you. 

In order for others following you to be able to find the caches in this series, please take neither the guidebook nor the pertinent log pages. You may want to bring a notepad along so you can jot down directions.

For this first cache in the series, begin at the suggested parking coordinates. About 130' west, you will notice a numbered road sign. Your trail begins right next to it. 

This first one has by far the most difficult terrain of any cache in the series, but it's not too crazy. The easiest approach follows the trail to a switchback all the way at the bottom of the rocks, then climbs around the right side of them. A lot of the rocks in this pile are extremely loose, and this approach avoids all that. If you choose another approach, terrain difficulty could get much higher. You are looking for a wide, flat, snap-lock tupperware.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Good Day,

It looks like your cache has been under the weather for some time. While I feel that Geocaching.com should hold the location for you and block other cachers from entering the area around this cache for a reasonable amount of time, we can't do so forever. Please either repair/replace this cache in the next couple of weeks, or archive it so that someone else can place a cache in the area, and cachers can once again enjoy visiting this location.

If the reason the cache is under the weather is something out of your control, such as construction or flooding, please post a note on the cache page with your best guess of when the conditions will improve. If the situation is temporary and is something out of your control, there is no need to archive the cache at this time.

I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to geocaching in the past and am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the future.

Thanks for your understanding - Cheers!

We were picking up trash while floating the Little D from State Rec to Stacy's house..  and found the previous cache merely by accident...   left a whistle here and grabbed the earrings so now both of them have a set.  They will be their special earrings to be worn while floating :-)   And... they are both hooked on geocaching.   Dang, I thought we'd never get to Stacy's house...   they had to look over, under, in front and behind every fallen tree in the river!!   Thanks for the cache.   None of us had a pen, couldn't sign the log,  so we figured the trade would be proof that we were there.</groundspeak:text>

Got to see lots of birds and a few deer and a couple of beavers.  The river is blocked between the second and third cache, but you can walk around the pine tree that fell in.   Had a few tubers along the way and saw a couple of yaks in the Crosswater section.  The takeout at the Sunriver bridge was busy as always.  Think I've now paddled the Little Deschutes from Lapine to the Deschutes River.  Thanks for the new caches.  The older "Golf" cache on the Deschutes is in need of a new log sheet.  Will try to post a different picture for each cache. T4TH</groundspeak:text>

No trees were killed to send this message, but a large number of electrons were terribly inconvenienced.

Oh freddled gruntbuggly,
Thy micturitions are to me,
As plurdled gabbleblotchits,
On a lurgid bee,
That mordiously hath blurted out,
Its earted jurtles,
Into a rancid festering confectious organ squealer. [drowned out by moaning and screaming]
Now the jurpling slayjid agrocrustles,
Are slurping hagrilly up the axlegrurts,
And living glupules frart and slipulate,
Like jowling meated liverslime,
Groop, I implore thee, my foonting turling dromes,
And hooptiously drangle me,
With crinkly bindlewurdles,
Or else I shall rend thee in the gobberwarts with my blurglecruncheon,
See if I don't.

First childhood, no limits, no renunciations, 
no goals. Such unthinking joy.
Then abrupt terror, schoolrooms, boundaries, captivity, 
and a plunge into temptation and deep loss.
Defiance. The one crushed will be the crusher now, 
and he avenges his defeats on others.
Loved, feared, he rescues, wrestles, wins, 
and overpowers others, slowly, act by act.
And then all alone in space, in lightness, in cold.
But deep in the shape he has made to stand erect
he takes a breath, as if reaching for the First, Primitive . . .
Then God explodes from his hiding place.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Oregon lily, aka Columbia lily: Lilium columbianum, a
perennial herb with showy orange-red, purple-spotted flowers.
Native to western North American prairies, thickets and conifer
forests up to 6,000 feet. Infrequently seen in Central
Oregon.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unmaintained trail is to the left of the trailhead for the
Tumalo Creek Trail where an old surveillance sign is posted. It
meanders between the creek and the higher trail to a point just
west of Cruise by the Creek 2, GC63F7, so you could hike a loop of
roughly 2 miles. It is quite steep where it joins the upper trail
and there are a few tree falls. You could also continue upstream on
the main trail to Penstemon, GC1V4NP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will pass through lush areas of dogwood and spirea (blooms
later in the summer) on your way to the cache. The cache is next to
the trail at a spot that is unremarkable except that there is a
beautiful Oregon Lily growing there. You are looking for a 3-inch
plastic jar from Putter&amp;amp;Sassy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: The log sheet erroneously gives the cache name as "Spirea"
which you will also see on this trail.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Cache is located west of Sunriver, off Forest Service Road 40.  There is a fabulous Halloween tree at the campsite, and since it is so close to Halloween, why not plant a cache.  The Map 60 was going crazy near the rocks and would vary as much as 40' so I didn't make this hide very difficult.  There is a 2006 pumpkin token from Oakcoins for first to find. Cache is located approximately 200' from parking.

Oh freddled gruntbuggly,
Thy micturitions are to me,
As plurdled gabbleblotchits,
On a lurgid bee,
That mordiously hath blurted out,
Its earted jurtles,
Into a rancid festering confectious organ squealer. [drowned out by moaning and screaming]
Now the jurpling slayjid agrocrustles,
Are slurping hagrilly up the axlegrurts,
And living glupules frart and slipulate,
Like jowling meated liverslime,
Groop, I implore thee, my foonting turling dromes,
And hooptiously drangle me,
With crinkly bindlewurdles,
Or else I shall rend thee in the gobberwarts with my blurglecruncheon,
See if I don't.

First childhood, no limits, no renunciations, 
no goals. Such unthinking joy.
Then abrupt terror, schoolrooms, boundaries, captivity, 
and a plunge into temptation and deep loss.
Defiance. The one crushed will be the crusher now, 
and he avenges his defeats on others.
Loved, feared, he rescues, wrestles, wins, 
and overpowers others, slowly, act by act.
And then all alone in space, in lightness, in cold.
But deep in the shape he has made to stand erect
he takes a breath, as if reaching for the First, Primitive . . .
Then God explodes from his hiding place.

No ones coordinates were right on for us, but those helped us get closer to GZ.      Having a group looking helped keep the morale up.      It did help to verify that container is in fact a regular 3x7 tin covered in camo tape.      Also helpful to know it's not in a bush.      Whew.  Good luck next caters!

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Got bored and went for a walk. This cache is on the east side of the Deschutes River.

Dont forget to pick up the other quality caches along the loop trail.

This cache Seems to move around. Checking and not seeing the "second" cache I replaced it with a third container. Hold on. The second container is there just in a slightly different spot. Long story short there are two container now on site. Either one gives you credit as a find.

All day we saw one group of 2 people and another group of 2 people with 2 dogs.  Hooray!  Found the cache in good shape and not covered in snow.  We took a few dog treats for our dog that had to stay home (he was sad) and left an Oregon button.  Amazing views! Lots of good swag in this cache.  Great day!  Thanks!</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I'm trying to do at least one cache a week this year and this one was the first. We snowshoed up from the Vista Butte Sno-Park (pass required), part on-trail and part off, on a sunny and calm day. Roundtrip of 3.4 miles with 785 feet elevation change in 2.5 hours including lunch at the top. 

We tried to do the cache last winter but got bogged down in incredibly deep snow. As it turns out, the cache would have been buried anyway. No such problem this year as there is barely a foot or two in most places and little at the top. Finished up the cache just as a couple of muggle groups showed up. 

Thanks for the nice hide. You could add attributes for bicycles, skis and snowshoes and give winter parking coords (N 43 59.020, W 121 36.385) as the butte is on an established trail system that connects to the trails at Swampy Sno-Park. It's moderately steep approaching the top but is otherwise relatively easy.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Good Day,

It looks like your cache has been under the weather for some time. While I feel that Geocaching.com should hold the location for you and block other cachers from entering the area around this cache for a reasonable amount of time, we can't do so forever. Please either repair/replace this cache in the next couple of weeks, or archive it so that someone else can place a cache in the area, and cachers can once again enjoy visiting this location.

If the reason the cache is under the weather is something out of your control, such as construction or flooding, please post a note on the cache page with your best guess of when the conditions will improve. If the situation is temporary and is something out of your control, there is no need to archive the cache at this time.

I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to geocaching in the past and am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the future.

Thanks for your understanding - Cheers!

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Not one to leave things alone, I decided to go check on this one after finding Moist Moccasins in fine condition.  I parked on the B-S Logging road near the corner of the private property fenceline.  I followed the fence about .37 miles and located the cache very easily.  Just as Moist Moccasins, I wasn't even able to see the burn area from the vantage here.  I signed the log and did the homework necessary for Two in the Bush.  Today was beautiful.  I was on cache at around 09:00 AM and it was already warming.  It is only supposed to be around 80 degrees today.  I found two in the Bush to not be too far away with a cache in between (I didn't find that one), and with some time to spend before my date at noon. I set off.  Thanks for the Smiley!!  I am grateful this series was unaffected by the Two Bulls Fire.  It would have been a shame.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Being a themed cache, bring a marble to exchange. The terrain is typical for the area: powdery soil, scrub brush, rocks and beautiful mountain views.

Upped the difficulty to a 4 since the final seems to be more difficult than we had thought.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Our first multi-cache.  Because this is located within the “Eighteen” fire area, the road is not officially open to motorized vehicles.  Parking is available off the main road. Since you’re already out here, take pictures of the mountain views, the formations and cavernous rocks and add them to your log.  

Being a themed cache please exchange marbles or travelers only. 

If you haven’t already sought out Bad Dogs “The Plug” (GCRTT2) it might be a quick smiley after getting  the first or second set of coordinates.

All coordinates will get you within 5' of each location.  Several readings taken using an Etrex Legend HCX to get the coordinates. 

Round trip not to include "The Plug" is approximately 1 mile when parking just off the road.

Enjoy!

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This multi cache has only one waypoint that leads to an ammo box.
 To find this cache all you have to do is some simple (I mean simple) brain work. At the first waypoint you will find a sign with a telphone number on it. The first digit of the phone number = A. B= the only number that appears twice.
(Example: 475-9217...A=4 and B=7)
 Add A and B to the following coordinates N 44.01.BA4 ,
W 121.19.7AB. This will get you to the log book and some goodies.

MAKE SURE TO FIND THE RIGHT SIGN-clue.

cachehounds, Skwirl the " Golden Girl". Biskit thought Skwirl
would&lt;br /&gt;
enjoy the awesome view to be had at this cache. If you choose
the&lt;br /&gt;
proper approach, a game trail, that COTA would be proud of,
will&lt;br /&gt;
bring you to the top, you will have to find that on your own.
It&lt;br /&gt;
may be a short climb, but it's steep, loose rocks near the
top.&lt;br /&gt;
Panoramas await you. Great views to the North. Do the caches
on&lt;br /&gt;
Wake butte first, and you can look back over to where you
just&lt;br /&gt;
were. Short spice jar.&lt;br /&gt;

Bushwacked through the manzanita on the way in and made the find after checking just a few spots. Found the game trail right before the cache so used that on the way out. What a view!

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache location is a few steps off of a public trail, at the base of a prominent cliff. Searching any farther past that would involve trespassing. The last few steps require passing over a few big rocks.&lt;br /&gt;
Please rehide it exactly as you found it.&lt;br /&gt;
This is a busy trail throughout the year, so employ an appropriate level of stealth in your search. If you don't know how to handle TB's please visit; http://www.geocaching.com/track/howto.aspx

Somebody stole our brand new cache box, what a bummer.  Fortunately they left the log book and Travel Bugs, they just took the box.

For obvious reasons we took the TB's and will log them into our inventory and drop them somewhere else.

So for now all that is there is a baggie, pen and one log sheet.

We are going to have to rethink this one and what we are going to do going forward</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">After noting the absence of the 9 trackables in the TB motel at the city hall, I thought it a wiser alternative to seek out a Premium motel. This one not only fit the bill nicely but we recognized the CO from following in his footsteps caching on Kauai in March. Hello again! 

Dropped off two, one in need of opening a few brews ( I know it's on tap in Bend, but still) and the other a sad snowman in search of Sochi. The skiing is better here anyway, right?

Adding parking coords would be nice for us out of towers. It took us awhile to find non restricted parking. 

Thanks for the secure posh motel. </groundspeak:text>

I went out to do maintenance on a cache I just adopted and wanted to find The Plug and The Plug 2 while out this way.  I had the correct coordinates to locate this cache as well, then managed to delete them somehow during my cache maintenance.  I completed the Plugs and re-researched this cache and got the coordinates again.  Quick in and out.  Grabbed the Travel Bug to move along.  Made a mark in the log.  Thanks for the smiley!!

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Are you amped for a winter cache? Batteries charged for a
challenging 5.5-mile round-trip ski or snowshoe? Marked trails in
beautiful area. No digging required.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Start at Edison Sno-Park off Forest Road 45. Park at south end of
lot which is shared with snowmobilers (they have their own trails).
Sno-Park Permit required in season. Dogs welcome. 
&lt;p&gt;Take a map at the trailhead sign, N 43° 55.870' W 121° 35.877'.
The area has stands of old growth ponderosa and lodgepole pines
amidst interesting lava formations. The trail, rated most difficult
in the second half, is steep and needs at least 2 feet of snow for
good skiing. Check the &lt;a rel="nofollow" href=
"http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/centraloregon/conditions/recreport-bdfr-win.shtml"&gt;
Forest Recreation Report&lt;/a&gt; for current conditions. The terrain
rating is for skiing under good conditions; it could be more
difficult when stormy or icy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The container is a slide box that cannot hold much. It starts
with a log, pencil, Oregon Geocoin (unnumbered to keep) and
Geocaching pin. If you short circuit this winter, find your own
route in the summer along the various roads and snowmobile trails
in the area or go cross-country.&lt;/p&gt;

Just a nice winter hike to get the blood pumping...I can't believe that this cache was last found by Bubblegummers in October of 2009..With all the folks that visit this shelter, thats amazing.  The cache was in good shape, well hidden.  We found a digitialfish in the cache kind of cool.  A TB but of a different sort.  We will take it to Eugene next week.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Headed out to do some caches in the Edison SnoPark area. This was my third and last stop on the trip. Hiked 8.1 miles in 4:03 with total accents of 1065 ft. Was the first finder this year and cache is still in great shape. Some parts of these trails are hard to follow as some of the diamonds have gone missing or are on downed trees. I hiked over from the Edison Shelter and had a trail map with me, but still had a few problems getting from the High Voltage trail to the Direct Current trail for the reasons mentioned above. Tried to come back on the Alternating Current trail but only made it part way before losing the diamonds. Cut back over to the Direct Current trail to finish the hike back. TFTH. SL

The total hike (edited for a couple of wrong turns) can be seen here. http://www.mapmyhike.com/route/us/or/bend/201125591815634118</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Picked the hottest day of the summer (so far) to make this hike.  No paper x-country maps are available in the summer at the sno-park, and the usual wooden signs with maps have been removed.  So, we took the dusty,hot, rocky motorcycle trails out to near the cache, and the much more enjoyable "Direct Current" trail back to the lot.  We'll come back in the winter with our skis to try again for the cache.

Dad pre-built the AC/DC shelter about 15 years ago at the log building yard in La Pine.  They dismantled the buildings then helicoptered the logs into place for this shelter, one up on Sheridan Mtn., and a few more in the area. I suppose the ski or snowmobile clubs re-erected the shell, then fitted the huts with roofs, benches etc.  Nice place to stop on a cold winter's day.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">You can hike, ride a bike or, if you are physically challenged,
drive a 4X4 close to the top of this prominent Central Oregon
butte. The best way to the top is a narrow, rough double track that
starts at a USFS gate at the NE base of the butte and ascends the
East side. The numerous windfall trees that currently (2006) block
the route prevent people from driving. All other routes involve
bushwacking through manzanita. The cache is an ammo box with an
orange lid. Pistol Butte once had a fire lookout which is an
indication of the quality of the view. Look for the Bald Eagle that
is sometimes soaring above the slopes below.</groundspeak:long_description>

Just as the manzanita started getting thick, we found a foot trail that brought us right up to to the summit. We stopped at some basalt bluffs and had lunch, with some great views to the south and west. At the summit, there was a bit too much snow for us to find the cache. We searched for awhile but gave up after Evan got too much snow in his boots. Got to wander around the old LO site, and see the remaining footing. Good family hike/scramble.</groundspeak:text>

Do not try and drive up this old logging road. It is blocked many times by fallen trees and brush. Just hike the remnants of the road though the woods and over the lava road to the kipuka you go. Power yourself up the little climb at the end to look around.


They sure went to a lot of trouble to harvest this little area of timber.

got back to the rig and just started back to the hiway when i spotted a small critter walking up the road.  turned out it was a small dog heading who knows where and who knows where he came from.  after about a half hour of coaxing (most of the time he just spent under the rig right in the middle where i couldn't reach him) he just comes out and jumps in the rig.  he got a free ride to the humane society where he will have a soft bed and something to eat rather than being coyote bait.  he did have a collar with a phone number and his name of "scrappy".  hope his owners get him back.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">After placing this cache I thought it should be named "Snowbrush I" but depending on your route of travel you will encounter your fair share of Manzanita also.

The cache is a cammo ammo can.  The placement of it wasn't my first choice but as I had a hard time getting good reception I settled for this spot.  I think when you get to the cache you will see where I would have preferred to put it.  After all the work just getting here the cache is pretty easy to find.

The most obvious parking spot is at N44*02.060, W121*32.651.  From this spot you will have approximately 0.26 miles to hike if you stay in a straight line (won't happen).  Your elevation gain will be about 650 feet on a slope that averages 53% although it gets much steeper the higher you get.  

Be careful, don't take little kids, watch for rolling rocks, enjoy the brush and savor the view.  This is ideal cat habitat so you might want to be packing.  Nobody is going to get here in 15 minutes.</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">well Zoe and I came up yesterday, hiked in from the backside which was tough due to the 4' of snow and didn't find it, so I called Kestle Ridge for a hint.,  came back today and parked at the gate which was the same distance but a much easier walk it. got up in there and looked agian in the same spots, this time we had good luck. the cache had not been found in some time so mother nature had added some more camoflaug. this was a great time, thanks</groundspeak:text>

So up and up and up we went and we got clear to the top and there was the cache 100' below.  Should have stayed below the cliffs and gone around.

After you have found the 2 waypoints you are looking for a small camo covered cache.  The container is about 4 inches wide by 3 inches high and contains a logbook, pencils, and room for small items only.

Take your time, enjoy the views, pay attention to your path, and some potential hazards like brush, rolling rocks, and did I say brush.  Oh yeah, there is some brush.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Do you know a joke? The whole idea behind this cache is to spread a little humor. We all can use a "light" moment to brighten our day. Please bring some sort of funny, joke or gag type item to trade, but be tasteful.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Finders are asked to log in and write a joke in the log book. Please remember that all ages view the log so make the joke appropriate. There is a joke book included in the cache, this book is intended to stay in the cache for inspiration so PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THE BOOK.

The cache is an easy 3/4 mile hike down a well used but little known (outside of the locals) trail. The last 50 feet is off the trail and will be a challenge to some.

The trail itself starts at:

N 44   02.160
W 121  19.103

Another great way to approach this cache is parking at Farewell Bend Park and using the river trail. This would make a great round trip if you continued upstream and crossed the foot bridge and came back down the other side of the river. There are a few other caches you could log by taking this route.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The third in the ongoing series of "Manzanita" caches.  Cachers have had so much fun with the previous two that it is time for another adventure in self destruction.

The cache is a small green ammo box.  Trade items should be limited to travel bugs and/or geocoins although your visit and signing the log is encouraged.  If you would like to leave something other than a travel bug or geocoin that is welcome.  Just make sure you trade for like items.  The cache has started out with three travel bugs.

You can park approximately 0.15 miles from the cache but after that the chosen route is up to you.  Yes, it is steep, brushy and there are numerous locations to hide a cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

I took a group of kids to the Tumalo Creek area for a field trip. I thought, "hey, I should find a few caches while I'm there." OMG Straight up through 5' tall manzanita. No trail, and constant feeling I was being watched. Creepy. I got to where I thought it should be, almost gave up (had to get back to the bus, it took me over an hour to find it) when I took one last glance over my shoulder, and shazam! there it was. Thanks for making my day. I was picking debris out of my clothes and hair for the rest of the day. [:D]</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Best to park at wide spot near radio tower and walk in.  The brush has really overgrown the roadway.  My paint job is not that good but sounds terrible when it scrapes the side of rig.  I had to hold my wife's hand on portions the the last 200 feet.  She does not like steep slopes.  We both made it.  It is a nice view down the canyon, you can see Skyliners Lodge and the areas thinning by the USFS over the past few years.  The USFS is undertaking a massive fuels reduction in the area to make it easier to protect the homes in the area when the next wild fire comes.  The Bridge Creek burn was in 1979 and the brush is ripe for an other fire.  This would be a great spot to spend an evening and watch the stars on a clear moon less night.

Nice hike from down below, we though
the road might be to narrow to drive, then 
we ran into a Jeep and the folk were from Texas
and they wonder if they were close to Dallas.
I don't think they were Geocaching.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">In beautiful Shevlin Park on the west side of Bend next to Tumalo Creek. There are several trails and a paved road in the park. When the road is open (usually spring-summer only) you can drive to within a quarter mile of the cache; otherwise, it's a pleasant 2-mi mountain bike, hike or cross-country ski from the parking lot off Shevlin Park Road. Elevation gain from the parking lot is about 150 ft.
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;img src="http://idisk.mac.com/main_street/Public/mtn-bike-friendly-art.jpg" align="right" /&gt;From the parking lot (N 44° 04.966' W 121° 22.694'), head up the canyon by road or trail. The road ends at Fremont Meadow (N 44° 03.714' W 121° 23.763') where the Fremont Expedition camped in December 1843. With enough snow the parks department sets ski tracks on the road.
&lt;p&gt;There are several trails in the vicinity of the cache which is located a few steps off one of the trails. Please stay on trails and don't bushwhack. If you get on the wrong trail, keep going until you get to a junction where you can backtrack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the cache, you can continue up the creek a little farther before the trail exits the park into the national forest. The trail climbs steeply out of the canyon and then continues for miles.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is a very special place; it will take you back in time. You may want to bring a picnic lunch or even try your luck at fly-fishing. The remains of this cabin were part of the original 1974 film set for Rooster Cogburn with John Wayne and Katherine Hepburn. This cache is accessible during the spring, summer, and early fall. It can also be accessed in the winter months depending on the depth of the snow. If you like to snowshoe or cross-country ski, this is a very good time to come. There is NO guarantee that you will find the cache, but you may luck out! The cache can be found in the "Back 40" among the wind fallen trees. The ammo box is located on the ground and is well camouflaged by natural materials. Enjoy this one and leave NO TRACE!

ATTENTION: If you find this cache, please make sure that you fully camouflage and hide the container so that it is well concealed. Thank you. </groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Easy to find ammo box near a steep trail above Tumalo Falls. Nice views of the Bridge Creek and North Fork Tumalo Creek drainages and the Cascades. Initial contents are mostly for mountain bikers.
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The trail:&lt;/b&gt; The Farewell Trail is a relatively new mountain bike single-track connecting the Tumalo Falls trailheads with the Mrazek Trial to the north. It provides a way for cyclists to complete a 9.5-mile loop combined with the beautiful North Fork Trail (one-way uphill for cyclists). To reach just the cache via the Farewell Trail, you are looking at 600' of elevation gain and a mile to the cache, which is why this is recommended as the downhill leg when cycling. Fun hike in either direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Getting there:&lt;/b&gt; The southern trailhead is at N 44°01.910' W 121°33.873' just before the Tumalo Falls parking lot, a Forest Fee area. If driving, go west out of Bend on Skyliner Road to its end where it turns right across Tumalo Creek. After the bridge, take a left at the fork on a gravel road to the Tumalo Falls parking lot. There are several ways to bicycle there; get a map available at bike shops or the Forest Service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Further adventures:&lt;/b&gt; After the cache, you can return the way you came or continue on many miles of trails, including a splendid 12-mile plus run down into Shevlin Park.&lt;/p&gt;

Stacy and Val had never seen one so they were thrilled!  None of us had a pen to log so decided to do a trade as proof we were there -- Stacy wanted the earrings so I left the only money I had -- three one dollar bills!   The horrible part of it all was it took what seemed like forever to get home -- Stacy and Val were hooked on caching and spent the rest of the float looking over, under, in front and behind every log and fallen tree in the darn river.

Got to see lots of birds and a few deer and a couple of beavers.  The river is blocked between the second and third cache, but you can walk around the pine tree that fell in.   Had a few tubers along the way and saw a couple of yaks in the Crosswater section.  The takeout at the Sunriver bridge was busy as always.  Think I've now paddled the Little Deschutes from Lapine to the Deschutes River.  Thanks for the new caches.  The older "Golf" cache on the Deschutes is in need of a new log sheet.  Will try to post a different picture for each cache. T4TH</groundspeak:text>

At first location you will find a adopt a trail sign. 
You will be using the 3 word name of the company that has adopted this trail (note name of cache). 

First add the number of letters in the 1st and 2nd words then minus the number of e's.  Then minus the number of t's.  One digit sum = A.
Add the number of letters in all 3 words multiply by the number of r's, minus 16.  Two digit sum = BB
New North cord. 44 01.ABB

Second add the number of letters in the last word and square it.  Multiply that number by the number of e's in the name, add 635.  Add that three digit sum to the west cord.  that is your new west.

You are looking for what else a ammo can.  Have fun and enjoy the walk.  There are others in the area so they make for a fun day.In ammo can you may find:  Hippo TB, Movers TB, hot wheels, flash light, glow stick, gift card, and more.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;div class="UserSuppliedContent" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;font-size:12px;font-family:Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, sans-serif;vertical-align:baseline;color:rgb(89, 74, 66);line-height:18.001800537109375px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3rd in the series. The whole point being that for those crazy cachers (myself included) who are trying for a caching streak of multiple days, weeks or months snow can be the bane of our existence. All these caches are placed near roads that should be cleared when there is snow and they will all be winter safe, no looking in rocks or on the ground. Note that this location is close to a school, I have kept them far enough away that no one is going to look like a pedophile but do try and not draw attention to yourself. To everyone else these will just be some easy caches in trees but I hope they help to save someone's streak &lt;img src="http://www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile.gif" border="0" align="middle" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always cache in trash out! Be safe, don't do anything you don't feel comfortable with and good luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6em;"&gt;P.S. I would love feedback on the helpfulness of hints, the accuracy of ratings or anything else that you can think of that would improve the experience for those after you&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p style="text-align:center;"&gt;The Shire is a neighborhood with houses modled after those hobbit houses, of storybook and movie imagination.  I decided that this little place needed a cache so show people who dont know about it what all is tucked back in here. &lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p style="text-align:center;"&gt;The shire was built in 2005 with 3.4 million dollars, soon after 3 houses were built the developer, Ron Meyers went bankrupt and halted construction. These houses consist of stone walkways, thatched roofs and circular doorways. You can drive around the culdesac to look at the houses located here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center;"&gt;As for finding the cache, stealth is required as for there are people that may be watching, and I would like to keep this conatiner here without replacing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center;"&gt;Dont be expecting much, but these houses really are pretty cool to me.  &lt;/p&gt;

As I got close to GZ , the snow was getting deeper and I am post holing ! At GZ the snow is almost 2 feet deep- I just keep saying- well- it is one star- and then I see NO HINT.  I am pleased to report this really is a ONE star because, despite the snow, it was in the second place I looked. When I say, LOOKED, I mean, the second place I had to dig. Now, if you really want it to be easy, go now , since you'll see  where I dug in the snow! Thanks for the star for my fizzy!</groundspeak:text>

I was feeling lazy and looking one I could drive to and I should have waited since this it was winter friendly but I didn't know that. Anyways I got to gz let the dogs out and all of once there was a doe and of coarse the stupid dogs chased her. I quickly got them to stop and put them back in the truck and her she came back to hang out. She stayed around 100 feet away and kept close as I made the cache and after, she let me take lots of pictures of her and went back to the cache after I hung out for 10 mins watching her....

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We turned around here in the bizarre tree plantation. I can't imagine what the foresters were thinking with the closely spaced rows of trees. Combined with the dense manzanita it looks like this was designed to feed a fire. Very different from the more natural forest we came through before. The cache is not water sealed and is damp inside.

align="right" /&gt;This 600-acre regional park is largely undeveloped
with a beautiful creek running down the middle. The park is
officially open from 7 AM to 9 PM although we have been there at
night. The main parking is at N 44&amp;deg; 04.966' W 121&amp;deg; 22.694'
although you could also start at the Shevlin Commons trail parking
lot to the east for a slightly longer route that starts above the
creek and has good mountain views. A paved road into the park is
open sometimes which would shorten the hike. The cache should be
accessible most of the year although winter snow or mud could make
it difficult to reach.&lt;br /&gt;

I've been to this park millions of times but never to this cool spot- that is one of the things I love about geocaching! I have to wonder -  did you know about this spot first or did you find it while scouting for spots? I  had no swag but it could some more and there is only 4 more pages in the log book. While running,  I listened to The 'new' Squeeze CD "Spot the Difference" . They still sound great and Chris Difford's voice is still amazing with the harmony. Favorite for me.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">A large ammo can located a fantastic area.  There are many paths you can choose, and none will disappoint you whether you  choose to hike the ridge, or go vertical from the west. I would recommend hiking in from the Wake Butte parking area, or you can get closer on via the dirt road approximately 100 yards to the west.  My GPS went a little screwy up here, (The Garmin is in the mail) but directional indicators were good, and the clue should get you there.  Watch the drop off to the West and NW, and enjoy!!!  As this is our first hide, we would appreciate any feedback.  Thanks, Skadog and the navigators</groundspeak:long_description>

You'll find a juniper laying down.
NW past the top, just a few paces,
a double trunk with yellow bases.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Beautiful views between the rain storms and the huricane winds on the hog back that day. I had no paper work or clue to go by, just a number on the gps.

And, we didn't put our hand in the obvious spot where the final location was because there are a zillion bees.  There are actually 3 different honeycombs in the stump.

This was a real cardio workout and should have done it before lunch instead of after lunch. Lots of blowdown to work around and over but the slope was the killer. Hiked .94 miles R/T in 1:06 (thats :46 up with numerous stops and :20 down) and total accent of 562 ft. Was a cool, crisp but quiet up on top and the view was great.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">was wondering when somebody would finally stick a cache up here.  came in on the 490 road and parked near the end where it is blocked for bigger rigs.

started hiking up the ne side.  a little brush but most of it can be avoided if you keep to where the bigger pp are.  about half way up i was cussing myself for wearing too much.  once i got on top i was glad i had it all on.  cool, cloudy and a bitter wind howling.  enjoyed the view, did the business work and bailed off the same way i came up and back to the rig.  this one will be shut down for the winter soon.

my humble opinion is that coming from the south would be a big mistake.  lava to cross as well as steeper slopes and softer ground.  god bless america and traditional family values.  RED NECK WEENIE!!!</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;Pill bottle hidden to be found on a snowy day, pencil included. Stealth is fairly important as there may be lots of muggles around here on school days. Meant to be easy for the winter months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2nd in the series. The whole point being that for those crazy cachers (myself included) who are trying for a caching streak of multiple days, weeks or months snow can be the bane of our existence. All these caches are placed near roads that should be cleared when there is snow and they will all be winter safe, no looking in rocks or on the ground. Note that this location is close to a school, I have kept them far enough away that no one is going to look like a pedophile but do try and not draw attention to yourself. To everyone else these will just be some easy caches in trees but I hope they help to save someone's streak &lt;img src="http://www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile.gif" border="0" align="middle" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always cache in trash out! Be safe, don't do anything you don't feel comfortable with and good luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6em;"&gt;P.S. I would love feedback on the helpfulness of hints, the accuracy of ratings or anything else that you can think of that would improve the experience for those after you&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The cache is an ammo can under a manzanita bush.  When placed there was only one trade item (a jeep travel bug) plus the logbook.  This cache is for travel bugs and geocoins only.  If you take one make sure you leave one.  If there happens to be more than one tb or coin in the cache make sure that at least one stays.

Enjoy the hike and the view!!!!!!!!!</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Manzanita is an old Indian word for "Abandon hope all ye who enter"....or maybe "guarenteed to shred your loincloth"... or maybe "please curse West Coast Weenie for every step".  Not sure which but they all fit.  By the time I was 2/3 of the way up the hill from the trail I had 3 buzzards circling overhead.

The first time I tried this one I came at it from above after getting the two Kelsey Butte caches and that is the way I'd suggest to do it.  It was much more difficult going up from below.</groundspeak:text>

I searched for awhile but the hint was not in sight.  I made  an emergency call to weenie.  He said the cache was under a manzanita bush.  That weenie, what a jokester.  I finally searched uphill about 25 feet from where the coords were leading me , above some downed logs.  I eventually spotted the "hints" on the ground and saw the cache.  I re-tied the "hints" to a couple of  branches.  They can now be seen from afar.  They are old and faded.  Thanks for the  hunt.  It brings back memories of working in the woods.  Bad memories.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was a slugfest… I hate manzanita. Managed to rip a new hole in my pants and the one that already existed was getting some unwelcome attention from the bushes in the area [:O] but we managed it in the snow. There was probably about 4-6 inches of snow and that made the way up more slippery than I would have liked. Took out a small rotten tree on the way and almost slid farther than I would have safely liked. Found the cache and the hint made sense when we were there and saw it. Beautiful views today as Bend was covered in a thick layer of fog, we were above that level though and could look down on the almost reflective surface that the fog was making. Well worth the view and the D/T matrix.

No trees were killed to send this message, but a large number of electrons were terribly inconvenienced.</groundspeak:text>

Yes, we got all kinds of geo-stats for this one (care to hear: daily smaile, Lonely points that we don't even need, Shotgun's Maitanence Points, Fizzy box....). Yeah, the manzinita sucked, and I guess GG ripped his pants, but none of that mattered...check out his pictures of the fog. I've never seen anything thing like that. Thanks for giving me a reason to come up here today. 

The hint was totally needed.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Headed out real early this morning to check on one of my caches down by China Hat Butte and did some caches on the way back. 
Appears we were the last ones to find the old cache up here. Hard to believe that it would get muggled up here, but I guess you never know. This cache is better hidden and doesn't have the "attracter". HIked .56 miles in 34 min. with 243 ft. accent. TFTH. TNL"[b][pink]Dubble Bubble[/b][/pink]"SL</groundspeak:text>

Glad to see that the Road 18 annual travel restriction does not apply to this southern exposure.  After bagging Fire Prevention, continued N-NE the short distance to rejoin 1810 at the southern fringe of the closure.  Bailey and BC</groundspeak:text>
