      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Short walk off Deschutes Forest Road 1110 on the way to the Black
Butte Trailhead. Placed at the edge of the Red Band, a strip of
trees with dead needles caused by a weather phenomenon. The
half-liter nalogene container can hold small items.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;img src=
"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/c59f629f-2f5c-4d3f-9259-722e1c4ada19.jpg"
align="center" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Park in the wide area at the first road switchback and take the
faint trail to the east. On your walk look to the right (south) for
trees with dead, rust-brown needles. You can also see the Red Band
as you walk above it on the Black Butte Trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black Butte's "Red Band" or "Red Belt" appeared in January 2009
because of rare weather conditions that fooled the trees into
thinking it was spring. The strip of rust-colored trees appeared
between 4,400 feet and 4,600 feet elevation on Black Butte. Similar
bands occurred across Black Crater in the Three Sisters Wilderness
and Green Ridge in the Metolius River Basin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This happened when the roots of the trees were still frozen in
cold soil while their needles thawed when exposed to warmer
temperatures, direct sunlight and the right winds. The needles came
out of their winter dormancy to start photosynthesizing. During one
step of that process, needles release moisture through microscopic
holes. Normally, the lost moisture is replenished by water the tree
takes in through its roots. But when the roots are frozen, the
water stops flowing, and the needles' water supply is shut off so
they dry out and turn red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just the right conditions occurred in mid-January when a
temperature inversion covered the bottom of Black Butte with fog.
It was cold in the fog but above it the air was warmer than usual
and the sun's rays bounced off the top of the fog, heating the air
surrounding the trees even more. The band's sharp upper edge is
probably caused by snow and ice that clung to needles above that
elevation, preventing the needles from warming up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many of the trees look bad, some of the needles are still
green and can photosynthesize to support the tree. The buds on the
trees are still alive, so in a year or two the dead needles will
fall off and new green ones will replace them. Most of the trees
will probably recover although the weakened trees are more
susceptible to insect attack, disease and fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the vegetable cache series on Black Butte. See
also Tomatoes, Green Beans, Spinach and Carrots. &lt;a rel="nofollow"

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Why did the lettuce cross the road?&lt;br /&gt;
To get to the Salad Bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Did you hear about the race between the lettuce and the tomato?&lt;br /&gt;
The lettuce was a head and the tomato was trying to ketchup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Knock Knock!&lt;br /&gt;
Who's there?&lt;br /&gt;

Lettuce in and we'll tell you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

align="right" /&gt;The old timers say: &lt;i&gt;Wait to plant your tomatoes
until the snow is gone from Black Butte.&lt;/i&gt; The same advice holds
for this cache which can usually be reached June-October. A steady
2-mile trail climb up 1600 feet will reward you with outstanding
views from this 6400-foot volcano. Avoid hot days and bring water.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Black Butte Trail starts at the end of gravel Forest Road 1110
(about 5 miles from pavement). There is a rest room--which you may
need after the washboard road!--and picnic table at the parking
area. Forest fee area with pay station at trailhead.
&lt;p&gt;The cache replaces the archived I-Butte (GC1054), one of the
early caches in Central Oregon from July 2001. Here's the poetic
hint from that original cache: &lt;i&gt;"Through the brush, standing on
top of the river, with the first and third president to the right,
a hood on your back, and looking at two sisters, you just might
break your top."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=
"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/6d6fe6ec-abeb-4cc5-afbf-1002036cf1f4.jpg"
align="left" /&gt;Besides the views, the hike passes through several
vegetation zones. Another cache, &lt;a rel="nofollow" href=
"http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=de26f239-784e-415f-93ae-9cd17a6d533f"&gt;
Green Beans&lt;/a&gt;, is on the way. There is an active fire lookout on
the summit constructed in 1995 to replace an historic wooden tower
which collapsed during the winter of 2001-2002. There have been
lookouts on this natural vantage point since 1910. You can also log
the summit benchmark placed in 1958.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black Butte the volcano erupted quite recently, roughly 20,000
years ago, along a fault that runs parallel to the Cascades. The
eruption also buried the Metoilius River, creating Black Butte
Ranch's swampy meadows on one side of the mountain and Metolius
Springs on the other, where the river now emerges. The Springs
looking towards Mt. Jefferson is one of the most scenic spots in
the state, and you can log the nearby cache &lt;a rel="nofollow" href=

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Monkchip 45s have been geocaching in this area for about 4-5 years now. Their ages are 8-14 currently and they wanted to create their own geocache for you to find. We've stocked it with the usual log book, pencil, some treasures obtained from the local dollar store and bi-mart (and anything else that wasn't nailed down at home).  When you take a left from the main road (onto the dusty dirt road), you'll see a natural spot to park and the three mini "sisters" poking up from the ground. You'll want to fully explore the "sisters" here. The cache is a clear/lime green tupperware type container about 1/3 the height of a standard ammo can.</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>If you can't find it in the usual places, you might want to look closer on the "cliff face" side near the large fallen/rotted log.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Cache contains log, neon golf ball, some fun kids toys and the like. Plan your trip on a Saturday/Sunday morning and pick up some freshly baked treats at the nearby store, (be there around 9:00 or they will probably be gone) then head off to find other cache's in the area!</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Red and I have looked at this location a whole bunch of times as we headed forth and back from crossing the Cascades.

We decided to place a cache here today just so we could get out of the house.  The cache container is cammo tape covered Ice Tea container of about 1/2 gallon. It is hidden very well due to the traffic that passes within about 5 feet of the hiding spot. Yes, you will have to move two rocks if the cache is re-hidden right. If you find it, just move the two smaller rocks and leave the big one there. (It was a bitch to place.)

This is a very good spot for watching wildlife, stars and just plain scenery. Take your picnic and optics and sit back and enjoy the view..  And yes, it is there where you don't want it to be. 

Afraid of heights? Take someone with you who is not. 
Tall and or take up a lot of room? Take someone with you who is not.

Didn't follow it all the way, took a few wrong turns, almost gave up a few times, but Mrs Moon stayed the course, and kept me on track.  Finally got on the right trail, and got to GZ.  Thought I found it once, in not that hard a place, but it wasn't.  Mrs Moon was climbing all over those rocks, while I was still catching my breath.  She is, by far, the best cacher of the two.  She ended up finding it for us.  Signed the log, took some beads, left a bear.  This fills a Fizzy spot for us, so thanks much for this cache.</groundspeak:text>

As I approached this one the next morning, I actually thought that I saw an angel hovering over the rocks, but when I climbed up there I realized that I was mistaken.
TFTC, a favorite where I will always remember a favorite vacation!

Started searching the easy places first, no luck of course. Working my way around I noticed something. Yep! but I can't really get it from here. Found a slightly better way and made the retrieval. Definitely makes you tingle getting there. Saved a couple of TBs, SL, RAF. Thanks for the thrills, the views, &amp; TFTC</groundspeak:text>

Others believe from somewhere in the Cascades.  
All I know is, Whoosh, there it is.  
And there it goes.  Cold.  Clear.  Clean.  

There are a lot of attractions in this area and a few caches also.  Try going downstream to the fish hatchery and look around.  Bring your camping gear and plan on spending a weekend in the area.  

This cache is not located at the main attraction due to the confined space and no real spot to hide a cache.  But it is in a parking spot for the attraction.  After finding the cache,  take a little hike down the trail and take a look at the largest one of its kind in the state.   

The cache is located near the parking area and in part of an old  Ponderosa Pine.  

The cache has been updated to an ammo can as of 05-14-02.   

It is an Okay hide,  not real well hidden but not an accidental find either.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We brought our little vintage trailer to the Sisters Woodpecker Festival for several days of heavy birding. 16 hours Thursday, 13 Friday, 9 Saturday and then four more days of hanging out at Camp Sherman. Today I did a 10.25 mile walk to go 7 for 8 in cache attempts along these trails.

Our trail maps from Switchbacks.com showed the trail from the headwaters to the other side of the river and four more caches to be continuous. It just didn't say that I needed to ford the river. Yikes but this is cold water! I tried with bare feet first but that only lasted 33 seconds. Bare feet in my boots got me across but boy did it ache. I kept my feet cool and comfortable for the second half of the walk though.

Anyway... thanks Log and Red for this fine cache and for pointing folks to this most interesting site.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">#305 - Second (and probably last) to find ... in 2013!  We were up from Corvallis and staying at Black Butte Ranch for a Hoodoo ski vacation. But with only 9 inches of snow there, we've been swimming, biking, hiking, running, sledding, and geocaching instead! I figured this would be a nice way to work in a run with some fun caching and that was indeed the case.  Though I wasn't on the intended road (I must have been on one parallel to the 400 road with downed trees and other obstacles), it was an excellent 35 degree morning for a run to the Timberwolf #1 and this cache.  I'd made a rough sketch of the roads and used it for my navigation aid to this spot and approached it from the NE, circling CCW around the butte to get to the top (I found out that it would have been far easier to have been on the road that wrapped around the east and south of the butte).  The view from the top was spectacular, will post pics if I can get them off my dumb-phone (forgot my good camera...).  

Spent a long time searching for this with no luck, then finally walked a good 50 yards away from GZ and then slowly approached again, noting my bearing and as I got close and the 'needle' began to waver I kept following my course and I arrived right at the hiding spot.  Hint was right on the mark.  The run back to BBR took about half the time it took to get here.  This cache would be a fun ride on a bike as well.

Thanks ever so much for bringing me out here: this was my best adventure during our stay at BBR.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Welcome to Abbey's Cache!  This cache is in honor of our new daughter's birth.  It is one of my favorite places in Central Oregon, and I couldn't believe nobody had put a cache in the area yet.

As you turn off the Highway, you will see a brown National Forest Road Sign.  Record the two numbers you see there, a four digit (ABCD) and a three digit (EFG).

The first coordinates are for the parking place.  It is a dirt road, that ends in a loop.  The loop has been "closed" so that it is no longer usable as a looped road, but there is ample room to turn around.

When you walk through the area inside the loop, you will see many trees of various sizes.  Count the ones that are "big" or "old," even dead ones (still standing ones, anyway.)  Ignore medium to small ones.  This will give you a single digit number (H) for your math.

Checksum for (H):
(H)x(A)+17=(H)x(E)+11

Danger on the Rock
(H)x65 added to your North Coordinates
(H)x50)+(A) added to your West Coordinates

When you reach "Danger on the Rock" you will need to aquire a new mystery number, (I).  Use the Danger to come to you conclusions.

Abbey's Cache
(I)x25 subtracted from your new North Coordinates
(I)x32 subtracted from your new West Coordinates

Enjoy the cache, it is our first!</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="True">[Found with Calliopal and her son and daughter-in-law. such a nice hike and view. I'm surprised this hasn't had more activity. The mystery is, it looks like the first page of the log has been removed and the only remaining entry, on the second page, was made in 2010 - though there's a Found post in 2013.

The log book was in a very tight zip plastic bag and I couldn't get it out without tearing the closure. So if someone goes after this, it might be nice to bring  1 gal. size (the quart size was a little small) zip close bag. I will if I go back. On the other hand, though this cache hasn't been logged for about 2 (or 5) years, everything was nice and dry.

Make sure you read the hint when you get to the second waypoint. In fact, because it is necessary to read in order to calculate the final coords, it isn't really a "hint" as much as a requirement.

Note Calliopal's comment about ticks and dress accordingly. But don't be afraid - four of us were bushwhacking and only one picked up some ticks. Wear a hat, tuck your pant legs into your socks, etc. Basic stuff no matter where you go pushing though the brush.

You don't have to go on top - you'll know what I mean when you get there - however, there is a board across some rocks, making a bench up there, and it is quite a view. But you will be happy with the view from the second waypoint too.

]
Because trees grow up, you'll want to use algebra so solve for H.

Doing so, you can stay on the main dirt road till you reach the gate - shortens the hike a little - but don't block the gate.

Pay attention to what side of the creek you need to be on and note/mark the bridges

The fact that you are picking up a number for the letter "I" at the second waypoint and there is an "i" in the danger you'll find, is just a coincidence. Use the hint instructions to determine the value "I" should have in the remaining calculations.

The trek takes you go a great view point, but the cache will be on the way back to your car - it's a good thing.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Greetings,

Your cache has a "needs maintenance" attribute assigned to it because of a recent log.. However, your cache does appear to be up and running at this time. If you have completed maintenance of your cache, could you please post an "owner maintenance" log?  This "removes" the "needs maintenance" attribute and shows your cache as restored to its fully-functional state.  Geocachers sometimes filter using this attribute; don't let your cache be filtered out unnecessarily.

Thanks,

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Very nice cache and another fave vote is to follow. I was caching up stream on the other side of the river and went to follow the trail over to this side and... no bridge. Later, at the end of my walk I saw a map at the Camp Sherman store that says "ford" at that point in the river. So the Switchbacks.com map was correct that the trail continues across the river and my feet got mmmigggghhtty cold. But I made it and came right up this fine hill. 

I did finally use the hint though the coords were pretty darn close. I just didn't see the telltale indicator. The cache is well hidden and in fine shape.  We don't typically trade so no problem with minimal contents. Great cache. Thanks</groundspeak:text>

Start your caching experience at the Riverside Campground, which is located right past the Headwaters of the Metolius, and find the trail along the river.  Once you have found all four caches, you can stop at the quaint Camp Sherman Store just past the fourth cache for a refreshing drink or scrumptious snack.

The cave is great to explore, but only open between April 15th and November 1, due to nesting bats. Don't step into the skylights when you're exploring around the area! 

There are fairly accesible roads right to the site, coming either from Hwy 242 (McKenzie Pass Hwy) from the south, or off Hwy 20/126 from the north, a bit West of the Black Butte Ranch entrance. Some of these roads (especially those coming from the north) are fairly overgrown and might leave your car with a few scratches.  I've been both ways, and taking the McKenzie Pass Hwy is your best bet.  

Also, you turn-by-turn navigation will be helpful, but don't rely on it solely!  

  The cache is hid in a typical cache spot a short ways from the cave entrance and the skylight holes, to avoid accidental detection.</groundspeak:long_description>

Earthcache&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US Forest Service, from whom I received permission to place
this Earthcache, has requested that I use the Camp Sherman Bridge
as the primary location (coordinates) and the Headwaters as the
additional waypoint. As with all projects on the Metolius, the
Springs are considered the most sensitive to any type of external
perturbation, including our recreational activities. Keep this in
mind when visiting the Headwaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the best description of the Metolius River is from a
paper describing the geology of the River but originally from
Oregon Geographic Names 'It flows from the north base of Black
Butte, full bodied, and icy cold, and after winding northward
through beautiful pine forests, swings around the north end of
Green Ridge through a canyon of great depth and majestic grandeur,
joining the Deschutes just north of the mouth of Crooked River'. A
spring is a location on the Earth's surface where groundwater
emerges in an amount large enough to form a stream (Manga 2001); in
the case of the Metolius a full blown river. The River is very
unique and belongs to a select group belonging to the National Wild
and Scenic River System, the designation protecting it from
development inperpituity. It is at the headwaters of another very
unique river system, the Deschutes River. The factor that sets this
system apart from other rivers is the fact that it has the most
stable flow, lacking large fluctuations in discharge, than any
river in the United States. This is due to it's exceedingly large
contribution from springs. Approximately 80% of the mean annual
flow of the Deschutes, near Biggs and confluence with the Columbia
River, is from groundwater (Gannet et al 2003).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Metolius Springs originate as a group about 200 yards apart
immediately to the north of Black Butte at an almost constant flow
of 45,000 to 50,000 gallons per minute (Peterson and Groh 1972).
Another 600,000 gallons of water per minute discharges from
tributaries and springs in the 35 miles from the headwaters to the
Deschutes River.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/8295b54f-e209-4edf-bb94-a5fd3689a18c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Metolius River, Oregon at the Headwaters&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The geology of the Metolius Springs tells an interesting story
as it is described by Peterson and Groh (1972). The geological
events that dominated the direction of flow of the Metolius River
began with the movement of faults in the region. This faulting
caused Green Ridge to rise along the valley of the Metolius forming
what is called a horst. The faulting also created a graben, an
elongated unit that formed the valley. The result was that the
ancestral river that once flowed west to east now flowed northward
The volcanism in the High Cascade and resultant formations of
basalt and andesite that built the Cascade chain of shield shaped
volcanoes also obstructed the western boundary of the Metolius
River graben. Other geologic forces that shaped the valley were
associated with glaciers that formed in the High Cascades and whose
moraines were carried eastward onto the floor of the Metolius River
valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now move ahead a few milenia to a later period of faulting, this
time in the Metolius Spring area and along a fault within the
graben that occurred some 500,000 years ago (Peterson and Groh
1972). The result was the formation of Black Butte, a cinder cone
that rises above the valley floor about 3,000 feet. With Black
Butte blocking the northward flowing Metolius River and effectively
damming the drainage, we essentially have the landscape we see
today; a northern part where the Metolius River flows today and a
southern part that contains Black Butte Swamp and Glaze Meadow and
the eastward flowing Indian Ford Creek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Origin of the Water at Metolius
Springs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1972 paper that I have cited so far, speculate that since
Black Butte blocked the northward flow of the Metolius River, it
forced the river to originate as groundwater and discharge at the
springs we see at the headwater. This paper further states that the
wetland/marsh area on the south side of Black Butte now acted as a
'sump or container' for water that flowed to the area, on the
surface or under ground, from the upstream watershed. The authors
noted that this area was 300 feet higher than the springs on the
north side and likely acted as a standpipe that keep a constant
hydraulic head on the water from the springs, thus maintaining
their constant flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recent studies, using techniques/methods that were not
available 40 years ago, have refined the theories put forth in
earlier investigations (Gannet et al, 2003). Without going into a
lot of detail their studies used regional geology, the distribution
and rate of groundwater recharge and discharge, water temperature,
and isotopic tracers. Isotopes are atoms with the same number of
protons, but differing number of neutrons; ie, different forms of
the same element.&lt;/p&gt;
Some of the methods they used to come up with their results
follow:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oxygen Isotopes as a tracer:&lt;br /&gt;
The use of oxygen isotopes in hydrogeological studies, and
specifically at the Metolius Springs, is one way they solved one of
the problems. The ratio of oxygen-16 (the isotope of oxygen 16) to
oxygen-18 in water can aid in the determination of the source of
the water at the recharge area. Concentrations of oxygen-18 tend to
be lower when the air is cooler, for instance during snowfall, the
isotope is heavier and condenses more readily and evaporates less
freely than oxygen-16. Winter ice can be 5-20 per mil lower in
oxygen-18 than summer precipitation. The measurement of these
isotopes at Metolius Springs water strongly suggested the majority
of the water fell as snow at colder elevations of the Cascade
Mountains within the 400 square kilometer watershed(around 50 km
away). This goes along well with the fact that this area has the
highest precipitation, high soil permeability and near-surface
rocks in the watershed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Heat as a tracer:&lt;br /&gt;
Another tracer used in groundwater studies is the use of heat or
the temperature of the water (Anderson 2005). It was known very
early (late 1800's) that deep circulation of groundwater could
account for hot springs. This area beneath the ground surface that
is thought to cause an increase in groundwater temperature is
called the geothermal zone. This zone varies in depth, but
generally occurs below a depth of 10 meters and is usually
represented by an increase of 1 degree centigrade per 20 to 40
meters of depth. Using this information and other data the depth of
the recharge area can be estimated. In the case of Metolius Springs
it was determined that the temperature was about 4 degrees
centigrade above estimated recharge temperature. The conclusion the
researchers came to was that the water discharging at Metolius
Springs followed a relatively deep flow path, in the order of a few
hundred meters. This goes along with the fact that the Upper
Metolius River is more to the liking of the trout than the colder
downstream water that receive water from colder sources.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Use of Tritium to estimate age:&lt;br /&gt;
Tritium is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen and has a half-life of
12.5 years. Half-life is the time taken for the radioactivity of a
specified isotope to fall to half it's original value. Tritium is
naturally produced in the environment in very small quantities. As
a result of atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons tritium
concentrations increased to levels significantly higher than
background and because it is added to the environment as water it
enters the hydrological cycle and eventually becomes concentrated
in water at levels detectable in groundwater. Further, because
tritium decays to helium-3, and by knowing the decay rate, an even
more accurate estimate of age can be made. Using this method and
others the researchers estimated the water discharged at Metolius
Springs to be between a decade to a few hundred years.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In summary, it is believed that the water that discharges at the
headwaters of the Metolius River are no older than a couple hundred
years, follow a relatively deep flowpath from the recharge area,
and originate primarily in the higher elevations of the Cascade
Mountains. So, these huge springs tell an interesting story not
only for the river they create, but also for the peculiar Deschutes
to which they drain.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-To Log This Earthcache, answer the following questions and
email them to the developer of the site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question 1) There is a large sign near the beginning of the
trail that leads to the Headwaters of the Metolius. Two theories
are mentioned on the sign regarding the origin of the water in the
springs. Which one is correct and give a brief description why.&lt;/p&gt;
Answer either question 2 or 3 (or both for extra credit):&lt;br /&gt;
Question 2) An olympic size swimming pool is 164 feet long, by 82
feet wide and 6.5 feet deep. If the Metolius spring water was
flowing 50,000 gallons/min how long would it take to fill the
pool?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question 3) Take the temperature of the Metolius River near the
Camp Sherman Bridge, being careful not to damage the streamside
vegetation. Compare the temperature you find here with that at the
springs (48 F). Give 3 potential reasons for the difference you
observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This logging requirement is optional: Take a picture of yourself
or the people in your group and your GPS unit with the viewing
platform at the headwaters in the background and include it in your
log. If nothing else this would assure me that you were at the
site.&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This is a fun EC.  We happened to be camping at the resort here for three nights and I spied this EC as the closest cache.  Four families were in our group and we were all here for the Sisters Woodpecker Festival.  Birding and geocaching trails along rivers work very well together.  We walked from stage one up to the springs and then I forded the river up there to visit four caches on the other side.  A great walk on a beautiful afternoon to a very impressive geological feature.  Thanks for this fine EC.

My sister, daughter, and I are visiting my parents from out of state, and took a short trip to the Wizard Falls Fish Hatchery. After hiking around that lower portion of the river we decided to stop in at the headwaters. Amazing how the river just appears, fully-formed, like Hera. Answers sent...&lt;br /&gt;

Park on the cinders and hop to the east side of the guard rail, thence uphill about 60 ft.  USE EXTREME CAUTION ON YOUR APPROACH, DUE TO HIGH SPEED VEHICLES!!  Keep the pooch and kids in the rig for this quick grab.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">We noticed this fruit-bearing apple tree about 15 years ago along Santiam Pass HWY.  Likely the old tree was started from an apple core tossed by a passer-by...early vehicle traffic, horse person, hiker, Indian, alien?  Oregon Geographic Names indicates that pioneer settler Andrew Wiley made his way with two others from the Willamette Valley to Central Oregon in 1859, when this route was a trail.  Originally, Santiam Pass was known as Hogg Pass, after Col. T. Egenton Hogg who attempted to build a railroad in the area. The current highway was mapped and constructed in the 1928-29 timeframe, so the apple tree started from a discarded apple around 80 years ago or sooner.

Enjoy the views and consider the hard time this old tree has endured.  Do not eat the apples, since the tree is probably stuffed with lead from the earlier fuel additives.  We grabbed a ripe apple and hope to plant it in Bend</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Eye-level when facing east from the roadway shoulder, 2 feet below the dangling bird house found in central part of the tree.  The local footing is loose, so take care.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Located at the Cache creek toll station. Surprised there is none here yet. Station dates to about 1865, on the old Santiamme wagon road.
Trees are thick , so i took two readings. You might try .787, and .472.
You should get close enough to pick it up.
Good hunting. Tahe a lunch. There are several in the area.</groundspeak:long_description>

A hint would be nice for people if your numbers fluctuate so much.

Somebody built this a while ago and it keeps getting beatup by the winters. We have been meaning to put a ammo box out for everyone for the last few years and finally did it this year. Lets just hope someone dont take the ammo box like every other one we have found this year. The kids filled this cache with lots of little trinkets so please feel free to take and leave.

&lt;br /&gt;
Mt. Washington is a nearly extinct volcano in the Cascade Range of western Oregon. This peak is the remaining central plug of a highly eroded composite volcano with an estimated age of no more than a few 100,000 years. Thick basalt flows make up the base of the mountain while mixed flows and ash comprise the upper portions of the debris pile surrounding the main peak. During the late Pleistocene the flanks of the summit cone were excavated by valley glaciers which extended more than 12 kilometers east and west. Glaciers and the general instability of volcanoes have together eroded it to the state we see today.
&lt;p&gt;Glaciated mountain regions exhibit a number of distinct features created by erosion such as cirques, horns, arêtes, U-shaped valleys, hanging valleys and truncated spurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="0" align="left" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="10"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="vertical-align:middle;"&gt;A &lt;b&gt;cirque&lt;/b&gt; (from a French word for "arena"), corrie (from Scottish Gaelic coire meaning a pot or cauldron) or cwm (Welsh for "valley") is an amphitheatre-like valley head, formed at the head of a valley glacier by erosion. The concave amphitheatre shape is open on the downhill side corresponding to the flatter area of the stage, while the cupped seating section is generally steep cliff-like slopes down which ice and glaciated debris combine and converge from the three or more higher sides. The floor of the cirque ends up bowl shaped as it is the complex convergence zone of combining ice flows from multiple directions.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="vertical-align:middle;"&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img width="250" height="150" border="0" src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/6da818b5-bb0f-4ca5-995b-75b6864a4b3f.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="vertical-align:middle;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Horns&lt;/b&gt; are pyramidal peaks which form when several cirques erode a mountain from three or more sides. Perhaps the most famous horn is the Matterhorn in Switzerland.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="vertical-align:middle;"&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img width="250" height="150" border="0" src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/dfa3a702-ada7-4b46-8a71-594dc7af678f.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="vertical-align:middle;"&gt;An &lt;b&gt;arête&lt;/b&gt; is a thin, almost knife-like, ridge of rock which is typically formed when two glaciers erode parallel U-shaped valleys. The arête is a thin ridge of rock that is left separating the two valleys. The edge is then sharpened by freeze-thaw weathering, and the slope on either side of the arête steepened through mass wasting events and the erosion of exposed, unstable rock. The word "arête" is actually French for edge or ridge.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="vertical-align:middle;"&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img width="250" height="150" border="0" src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/1233f7e7-5e74-4835-80db-099699ac0dc0.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="vertical-align:middle;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;U-shaped valleys&lt;/b&gt; are valleys carved by glaciers becoming visible upon the recession of the glacier that forms it. When the ice recedes or thaws, the valley remains, often littered with small boulders that were transported within the ice. Floor gradient does not affect the valley's shape, it is the glacier's size that does. Continuously flowing glaciers – especially in the ice age – and large-sized glaciers carve wide, deep incised valleys.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="vertical-align:middle;"&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img width="250" height="150" border="0" src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/38cb4985-54a4-429b-a912-3a2b526013a3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="vertical-align:middle;"&gt;A &lt;b&gt;hanging valley&lt;/b&gt; is a tributary valley with the floor at a higher relief than the main channel into which it flows. They are most commonly associated with U-shaped valleys when a tributary glacier flows into a glacier of larger volume. The main glacier erodes a deep U-shaped valley with nearly vertical sides while the tributary glacier, with a smaller volume of ice, makes a shallower U-shaped valley. Since the surfaces of the glaciers were originally at the same elevation, the shallower valley appears to be ‘hanging’ above the main valley. Bridal Veil Falls in Yosemite National Park is an example of a hanging valley.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="vertical-align:middle;"&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img width="250" height="150" border="0" src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/f1fa8245-c544-42e8-847f-fc31b0e8b976.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="vertical-align:middle;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Truncated spurs&lt;/b&gt; are blunt-ended rock ridges which descend from the steep sides of a U-shaped valley and are often separated by hanging valleys. Valley glaciers tend to follow a straighter course than river channels and erode the interlocking spurs of the upper course valley, cutting through the projecting ridges.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="vertical-align:middle;"&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img width="250" height="150" border="0" src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/2796263f-5f08-4123-90c8-8a4d19a68f72.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To log this cache email me the answers to the following questions;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Observe Mt. Washington and the surrounding landscape and identify two features created by glaciation. All answers are subjective and there is no correct answer, simply state what you observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Two animals are pictured on the sign “Survival in a forest of trees”. What are they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Glaciers are also responsible for many other formations and phenomena not directly related to the alpine environment. For more information please see the following references.&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">I've seen this waterfall from Hwy. 20 before and decided to see if I could find my way out to it. A Deschutes National Forest map will show you the access roads, but not the old, decommissioned roads that you can use to approach the cache. They are shown on the topo maps of the area.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">First of all, this cascade is not on the named Cache Creek south of Cache Mountain. It is on an unnamed creek draining Cache Lake, just northwest of the mountain. Seemed like a snappy title for the spot, so there you go. This creek drains down toward Blue Lake, where there is no inlet, so it presumably filters through the cindery soil to join the lake. 


Don't plan to drive all the way to this cache. I had a 0.7 walk along closed roads from where I parked the Subaru; ATVs and motorcycles can get closer, but not all the way there. The last couple hundred feet is easy bushwhacking. The cache site would make for a pleasant tent location. You are looking for a green plastic lock box on the small side of regular.

From what I have noticed in the past, this creek is highly seasonal. The cascade was flowing impressively the day I placed it, but the stream seems to get pretty low in the fall. Watching your step while enjoying the sights; there's a vertical cliff just below the viewpoint.</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>The cliffs at this site are precipitous,
And will lead, not to victory, but woe.
Just follow the snag with the silvery skin
To the first place there's room down below.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

I was just about to call it quits when 4635 called out that she had found it - wow, what an awesome cacher she is! Speaking of awesome, the cache container is that. Gotta get some of those! We saw a lot of footprints all around the area, and the only logical conclusion was it was someone else looking for the cache. Thanx for the fun!

I wasn't too optimistic about finding a cache that hadn't been found it such a long time.  A picture a previous logger posted was quite helpful.  Cache is still there and in very good condition.

Drove within about .16 crow and hiked the old road until we reached the creek. There was no dry creek bed to hike down today as the water and falls were flowing with the winter melt so hiked up on the top and over to the cache. Great views from up here. Made it a favorite.

Rained last night and knocked some of the dust down which was nice.  Had a few glitches along the series but worked them out and found everything we looked for.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Went with Putter. this morning to find all the new caches west of Sisters.  Didn't realize there were so many roads out here.  Think we met ourselves coming a few times.  No dust today and only saw a couple of muggles in our travels.  But didn't get to see any deer or wildlife either.  Think we got them all and had a good time doing it.  Thanks for getting us out of the house and adding to our smiley total.  T4TH

Our goal was to find all his caches north of Hwy 242 by riding our bicycles to the cache sites.  Except for 1 isolated cache, which we didn't attempt, we succeeded!  All afternoon we struggled with inexact coords, but we still managed to find 34 caches.

We didn't have access to your photos when we were on the hunt, but we managed to locate the cache anyway.  Thanks!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">You don't want to miss this opportunity for some of the most breath taking views in the Oregon Cascades.  It almost seems like you are looking down on the Three Sisters, Mt. Washington, Three Finger Jack, Mt. Jefferson, etc.  You can also get a good view of the various forest fire damage that has ocurred the last couple of years. &lt;p&gt;This cache is a replacement for my earlier 'Cache Country'.  The forest fires burned up my intermediate waypoints twice, yet only came within 20' of the cache itself.  For those of you who have already visited, this is your opportunity to revisit and get another find.  I will continue with the same logbook.&lt;p&gt;High clearance vehicles are recommended.  For one scenic tour, start by getting off Hwy 20 at Corbet Snopark (3 miles east of Santiam Pass).  Follow road 2076, turn left at road 600.  Swing around the east side of Cache mountain and find your way to the top.  &lt;p&gt;Along the way, make a stop at Cache Lake.  Please report on the fishing if you can.  &lt;p&gt;At coords 44*21.765N ..121*45.548W, check out the remains of the Cache Creek Toll Station, the eastern toll station for the original Santiam Wagon road.  This was the road that linked Sweet Home with Prineville in the earliest days of Oregon.&lt;p&gt;Bring plenty of film and a lunch.  Enjoy.</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Woo Hoo! This was number 9,000 for us. A fitting cache for the occasion with awesome views and a challenging drive to the top. We nearly stopped a couple of times to get out and hike because of the large rocks in the road, but managed to manuever around them and get there in the geotruck. Didn't have to use the 4WD, but a higher clearance would have been handy. It was a bit hazy and smokey, so the views of the more distant mountains were a little obscured. Found all the footers for the lookout tower. Looked around to see if there was a benchmark, but didn't find one. Thanks for putting this one here. Gets a fav from us. TN.

Turns out there was a better road I could have taken, but that's OK; I needed the exercise. It was a nice, solitary walk in the woods. I came upon GZ and, after some trepidation in this sort of terrain, came upon the cache. It's a good morning for this type of activity. Thanks. TNLS [white]

Nice easy stroll through the tewlies, sort of like over the river and through the woods, only there's no river. Just a little cave-hole on the west side of the outcrop.  Please be sure the two covering rocks get wedged back EXACTLY the way they were so critters don't rattle them loose and expose the cache, which is a large Tylenol bottle wrapped in black tape - it blends great with the interior of the hole!</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Today we planned an assault on Sea Flyer caches west of Sisters in the vicinity of Cold Springs Campground.  Our goal was to find all his caches north of Hwy 242 by riding our bicycles to the cache sites.  Except for 1 isolated cache, which we didn't attempt, we succeeded!  All afternoon we struggled with inexact coords, but we still managed to find 34 caches.

This one was difficult on a bike.  The road suddenly ended at a barbwire fence -- Hap Taylor told us to keep out!  We had to push our bikes through the brush downhill to the corner marker.  Happily, another road awaited us.  T4TC.</groundspeak:text>

Cache is an ammo box, filled with stuff from the Dollar Store.  Nothing of great value, but fun stuff for the kids.  :)

This was named "Grasshopper Cache" because there were about 30 grasshoppers around us when we pulled over to hid this cache and our young boys were have a blast trying to catch them.

Enjoy the hunt.</groundspeak:long_description>

Our goal was to find all his caches north of Hwy 242 by riding our bicycles to the cache sites.  Except for 1 isolated cache, which we didn't attempt, we succeeded!  All afternoon we struggled with inexact coords, but we still managed to find 34 caches.

This cache did give us a nice view, and we enjoyed the solitude of riding this old road.  T4TC.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was the first cache I looked for this morning, and the last. I don't geocache so well when surrounded by specimens of the rock variety, so I expected this one to take me a small while. After a good half-hour of searching, I decided to go grab the other caches on my list before it got too hot, or before it rained, which was forecast with a significant percentage today. I came back after the others were gotten and spent yet another half-hour searching. Nada. That was surprising to me, because the other caches were not this difficult to find. Frustration began to settle in. Well, I haven't had breakfast yet, so I'll just head in to Sisters for some coffee and some reflection.

It's amazing how a good cup of coffee can make the day come alive. I checked the listing for this cache and consulted the photos,  now that I had a couple bars on my phone. I didn't quite remember the terrain in the particular configuration shown, though I reminded myself that rocks can look very much alike when they want to. Considering the angle of the parking spot and the apparent distance from the road, I concluded I may have been looking in the wrong place by far.

So I headed back to GZ a third time. This time I kept the GPSr off and those visual clues in mind. I even kept my good street clothes on instead of changing back into my grubbies, which wasn't the best decision I've ever made. But after some very careful acrobatics in the rocks, I found the cache. I was very relieved that I could leave the area with my goals completed.

But frankly it would have been nice to have started looking closer to true GZ, so I took a few coordinate samples over the next several minutes and, after discarding one outlier, am posting their average here with a tolerance of 22 feet. Sure, that tolerance can be confounding in this terrain, but it's still a goodly distance from where the original coords had sent me. Hopefully this will help future visitors. Who knows, they might not even need to head back into Sisters to view the photos, not that that would stop them.</groundspeak:text>

Our goal was to find all his caches north of Hwy 242 by riding our bicycles to the cache sites.  Except for 1 isolated cache, which we didn't attempt, we succeeded!  All afternoon we struggled with inexact coords, but we still managed to find 34 caches.

We're almost done for the day, too.  T4TC.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Hi, this is a standard text due to time constraints. 
On our this year USA travel we searched, found and logged this interesting cache. Today we had a trip from Eugene, thru the Cascades, and around the crater area with Belknap and Mt. Washington, then back to Eugene. On this tour we collected many nice caches. But in either case there were too many for a single day. So we collected these caches which were on or near our visited objects.  This was a good find and we had much fun in this special area and location. Many thanks to the Cache Owner for bringing us here and for the maintenance of this cache.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Hi, this is a standard text due to time constraints. 
On our this year USA travel we searched, found and logged this interesting cache. Today we had a trip from Eugene, thru the Cascades, and around the crater area with Belknap and Mt. Washington, then back to Eugene. On this tour we collected many nice caches. But in either case there were too many for a single day. So we collected these caches which were on or near our visited objects.  This was a good find and we had much fun in this special area and location. Many thanks to the Cache Owner for bringing us here and for the maintenance of this cache.

Cache is an ammo box, filled with stuff from the Dollar Store.  Nothing of great value, but fun stuff for the kids.  :)

This was named after my son (Justin) as he found this location and wanted it to have his name.  

Enjoy the hunt.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Greetings!  Here is another reminder of the destructive power of a forest fire.  This location was impacted by the combined forces of the Bear fire and the Booth fire (hence the B&amp;B complex)  Inside this cache you will find a map of the fire and additional information.  Also the First finder will be treated to a Beanie Smokey Bear doll!  Good luck and be careful out there.

Check out this website for more fire info and pictures!

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Hi, this is a standard text due to time constraints. 
On our this year USA travel we searched, found and logged this interesting cache. Today we had a trip from Eugene, thru the Cascades, and around the crater area with Belknap and Mt. Washington, then back to Eugene. On this tour we collected many nice caches. But in either case there were too many for a single day. So we collected these caches which were on or near our visited objects.  This was a good find and we had much fun in this special area and location. Many thanks to the Cache Owner for bringing us here and for the maintenance of this cache.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Hi, this is a standard text due to time constraints. 
On our this year USA travel we searched, found and logged this interesting cache. Today we had a trip from Eugene, thru the Cascades, and around the crater area with Belknap and Mt. Washington, then back to Eugene. On this tour we collected many nice caches. But in either case there were too many for a single day. So we collected these caches which were on or near our visited objects.  This was a good find and we had much fun in this special area and location. Many thanks to the Cache Owner for bringing us here and for the maintenance of this cache.
OUT: 1 x TB - logged separately.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Today we continued our assault on Sea Flyer caches west of Sisters in the vicinity of Cold Springs Campground.  Our goal was to find all his caches south of Hwy 242 by riding our bicycles to the cache sites.  All afternoon we struggled with inexact coords, but we still managed to find 21 Sea Flyer caches plus 3 others.

This cache was along a road we hadn't traveled before.  Thanks for the cache and for bringing us here.</groundspeak:text>

Pablo Mac &amp;amp; Son Aliex camped out on the other side of this picturesque lake during a church trail ride event. We will definitely be coming back here to ride and camp again!

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">I've always loved this little hill and the old Junipers that grow/grew there.  It's an easy hike from stevens canyon road or the first major spur road off of there.  Cliimb the gradual hill and you will find yourself in the middle of a little rocky clearing with some very old junipers many of which are dead and covered with moss.  Some call them "ghost trees" as even though they aren't living any more they still stand tall and unique.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache is a small ammo box with assorted key chains.  Please only trade key chains if at all possible.  We would like to keep this theme going and seriously...unless you walked here you should have a key chain on you to trade...right?  Not a hard hide, but there are so many potential hiding places in may take a little exploring.</groundspeak:long_description>

The short hike to the cache was interesting -- the soil was frozen, so we were sometimes on top of the crust and sometimes dropping through it.  Gunshots could be heard in the not-too-far distance, and we hoped the shooters were aiming away from us.  The cache is in good shape.  T4TC.</groundspeak:text>

The search at GZ took a small while, since the coords jumped a bit hither and yon, but then I put the GPSr aside and looked for visual clues. Found the cache shortly thereafter. OK, now how do I get back? Luckily I had remembered to take a waypoint at my car, and whaddayaknow, I hiked over a ridge and there was my car, right in front of me.

Our goal was to find all his caches south of Hwy 242 by riding our bicycles to the cache sites.

This was yet another bushwhack off the nearest road.  Stashed the bikes and hiked.  Found it.  Thanks!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">A short but steep hike to a great view of Mt. Jefferson, Three Fingered Jack and Hayrick Butte.  Also Link, Meadow, Torso and other small lakes.

The cache is a 50 cal. ammo can with the usual stuff.

The best route is from Hwy 126 and then take FSR 2067 to the 500 rd. then 2 mi. to parking.  N44 22.300  W121 48.413

Once the snow arrives the cache will be inaccessible.  There are a lot of snags in the area so if the wind is blowing be careful.

Have fun</groundspeak:long_description>

Hit a huge rock on the bottom of the rig, but fortunately did no damage.  A boulder blocks the road halfway up, so we backed a quarter mile back where we had come from the Hortense Jct.  A much better approach is from the east and the access to Cache Mtn., as we later found.  Ticks are out today in this damp area.  We will be back another day and try the approach from the better road to the east at the Cache Mtn. jct.  Bailey and BC</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This turned out to be our favorite cache of the day, although we weren't sure we were going to find the cache given 2 previous DNFs.  We spent much time searching where the posted coords led us, to no avail.  Hoping there would be cell service, Mrs. Tbird tried the iPhone app for more logs and (hopefully) photos.  The 2 photos weren't especially helpful -- the prominent tree in one picture is no longer standing.  But, the logs revealed that the coords had been changed more than a few times.  

We used Kestrel Ridge's coords, since 2 people found the cache after KR posted.  Mrs. Tbird was searching one crevice when she looked at the GPS in her hand; it read 1-foot!  A slight adjustment in the search yielded the container!  Hooray!

Since there are no hints given, see our photo to understand what you are looking for.  Remember, there is no need to climb.  And use Kestrel Ridge's coords.  T4TC.</groundspeak:text>

You are looking for an ammo can. I got a lot of variation in my readings, but considering the limited numbers of places suitable for hiding, it shouldn't be too difficult. When you find it, look on the back of the log book for the coordinates to the bonus. There is also a hint included for that cache. It's one you won't want to miss.</groundspeak:long_description>

Our goal was to find all his caches south of Hwy 242 by riding our bicycles to the cache sites.  All afternoon we struggled with inexact coords, but we still managed to find 21 Sea Flyer caches plus 3 others.

This was in an area we'd never been before.  We found the correct road to get close, then found the cache.  We also found the refrigerator and TV someone dumped just down the road.  Yuck.  T4TC.</groundspeak:text>

crossroads, but I don't know if it is possible to get to it from
there without owning a house so that you can go out the back way.
The difficulty varies with how you get there. There are trails
either way.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;There are some road intersections near here. See Google Maps for
more information. To get to this on a bicycle from downtown
Sisters, come down highway 242 and look for Edgington road on the
left. When you get there, there should be a dirt trail that runs
parallel to the highway for a short length (but not seeable from it
because of trees) like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="margin: 1.5em;"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
   Path --&amp;gt; |  |&lt;br /&gt;            |  |&lt;br /&gt;Edgington   |  | &amp;lt;-- 242&lt;br /&gt;------------|--|
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0;"&gt;After you are on the bike path, use your
GPS to get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a "power line" road that crosses 242 that you can
walk or bike from.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Cache contains log book, along with children's toys, as it was designed by my boys, ages 5 &amp;amp; 7. There is a dirt road leading to the cache that is best accessed by motorcycle or ATV, or also by hiking. Cars/trucks can drive on this road, but there are often trees down and you may not be able to get through. This is a beautiful area and the Lava Beds are quite impressive!

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Loved this road along the lava flow, I was lucky the topo maps I had loaded into my GPS had great detail and I found the right way in quickly.

Since there are so many roads, and so few signs, I wrote down my route in case it will help some future geocacher:

1. From hwy 242, turn north on Road 1028. 
2. Drive 0.7 miles and turn left on Road 1030.
3. Drive 2.1 miles and turn left on Road 200.
Drive a couple of miles down this road until you get to the cache location. It's in the lava which, as we know, is so easy to find stuff in, haha!

Thanks for the super fun cache, it's neat to see this other side of the lava!</groundspeak:text>

There was, however, enough time to look for this one, and luckily it wasn't too difficult to find, though I have a history of me not finding things in rocks, and there are a lot of rocks here. The road was open and navigable by car with some attention to a few small obstacles and ruts. Afterwards I returned to spend the night at Dugout Lake. TNLS</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">This cache is to promote the Sisters Tie Trail that leads from Sisters to Indian Ford Campground. Although the trail is six miles in total length, the cache is only about 3/4 of a mile in. It's a great small hike, dog walk, mountain bike ride, horseback ride, or simple walk to ground zero but invites you to take on the complete journey! You will need information from the short journey in order to complete cache as it's under a lock so keep your eyes peeled.
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This trail starts just North of the Sisters Ranger Station and meanders to the Northwest on a series of old roads and single track to Indian Ford Campground. Portions of the tread are soft and make for a more difficult bike ride. The vegetation along most of the trail consists of second growth Ponderosa Pine and Juniper in the overstory, with Itterbrush in the understory. During the winter and fall you can expect to see deer moving between sources along Indian Ford Creek and the forested areas where they browse on the grasses and forbs. You will see Black Butte area and eventually links to the Suttle Lake.
&lt;p&gt;In order to crack the cache combination you will need to acquire the following information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1ST NUMBER:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the trail head you will find a wooden bulletin board with the trail map and other notifications. On the "CAUTION Residential Area" sign, take &lt;b&gt;the NUMBER OF YARDS that it is illegal to discharge a firearm from a residence and SUBTRACT 115.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://s20.photobucket.com/albums/b202/cminti/?action=view&amp;amp;current=sisterstietrailcache0062-2.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b202/cminti/sisterstietrailcache0062-2.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2ND NUMBER:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the short hike down the trail to Ground Zero, you will see trail marking posts. &lt;b&gt;Keep track of the number of posts&lt;/b&gt; as this is the second number in the combination. &lt;b&gt;DO NOT&lt;/b&gt; count markers that are on the trees, but do follow them to keep you on the trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://s20.photobucket.com/albums/b202/cminti/?action=view&amp;amp;current=sisterstietrailcache0032-1.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b202/cminti/sisterstietrailcache0032-1.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3RD NUMBER:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final number can be determined by counting &lt;b&gt;the number of PARKING POSTS at the trail head and then ADDING 4 to the total&lt;/b&gt;. Don't forget to do this before you head out, or the short hike will become a bit longer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://s20.photobucket.com/albums/b202/cminti/?action=view&amp;amp;current=sisterstietrailcache002-2.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b202/cminti/sisterstietrailcache002-2.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have acquired the numbers for the combination and make it to Ground Zero, you will have to input the numbers in the following order. Remember to spin the dial &lt;b&gt;RIGHT&lt;/b&gt; a few times so it's fresh to try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Right to the 1st Number, Left all the way around past 1st Number to the 2nd Number, then Right directly to the 3rd Number and open.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please respect the cache and the forest. Trade evenly for TBs or items. Rehide the cache as you find it while also covering up your tracks. Report any maintenance that is required. Feel free to bring along trash bags for CITO as the trail takes you by an old pit that was used for dumping many years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Historically, Indian Ford Meadow served as a camping spot for Native Americans moving between the Deschutes River and the Cascade Mountains.  The original path of the Old Santiam Wagon Road is believed to have run through this meadow.  

Indian Ford Creek was known as the "Big Slough" to early homesteaders, reflecting the extremely wet meadow and marshes fed by the creek.  The area was homesteaded and became part of the Willows Ranch, one of the earliest ranches in the area.

Please park and use the entrance at the given additional waypoint.  This area is right off of Camp Polk Road.  Please enjoy your stay, and keep to the paths provided.

Tyler spent his 16th birthday in camp and we both were successful in filling our tags.  Tyler was lucky enough to fill his near this spot on the last day of the hunt.  One year later, Tyler was diagnosed with a heart ailment that will forever restrict his life.  One of the things he is still able to do is hunt and be out in the great outdoors.  This is one of our families favorite places to camp and hunt, and of course geocache.</groundspeak:long_description>

We are always amazed at Pioneer cemeteries - and this one, was probably the most eclectic  and unique tchotchked one we have ever seen.  It was a delight to see it all, and impressed that the cemetery is still being used.

We wandered around and found the correct residents - and then wandered around some more.  We did our calculations and headed off for the cache.    When we reached ground zero - we wandered about, and found the cache fairly quickly.

On our this year USA travel we searched, found and logged this interesting cache. Today we had a trip from Eugene, thru the Cascades, and around the crater area with Belknap and Mt. Washington, then back to Eugene. On this tour we collected many nice caches. But in either case there were too many for a single day. So we collected these caches which were on or near our visited objects.  This was a good find and we had much fun in this special area and location. Many thanks to the Cache Owner for bringing us here and for the maintenance of this cache.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We were on our way home from a very long journey up to the Tri-Cities area of Washington, and a few stops in eastern Oregon.  It was almost midnight as we pulled into Sisters, so we decided to stop and grab this cache.  It took a few minutes to hunt it down, which was perfect for what I needed!  Unfortunately, the outer container is in sad disrepair, and there was no inner container nor log.  We had read the previous logs warning us of this, so brought a little container and a sheet of waterproof paper to place in the outer container.  We could do nothing to fix that up, it's really beyond repair.  If I end up heading that way in the near future, I have a nice replacement you can have.  Anyway, we were happy to get my COTD finished that early in the morning as we were extremely tired by the time we got home (2 a.m.) and not really interested in leaving the house much until we'd rested.  The heat this weekend zapped our energy.  Thanks 4 placing this one, it looks like it was really cute before it crumbled!</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;i&gt;She eventually made it from the
&lt;b&gt;WEST&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;br /&gt;
Escapin’ a hangin’ to which she’d confessed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;i&gt;In the &lt;b&gt;WEST&lt;/b&gt; she took to
stealin’ cache,&lt;br /&gt;
To pay for her longin’ for minty stash.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The law caught up with Missus
Dale,&lt;br /&gt;
But she knew she couldn’t post the bail.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;i&gt;She’d thought to start over in
this small town,&lt;br /&gt;
But found the Altoid Tins kept her down.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The minty drops were still
a’callin’,&lt;br /&gt;
Which left poor Martha screamin’ and bawlin’.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;i&gt;She stole now from her neighbor
Sue,&lt;br /&gt;
And her past caught up with her anew.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The rope was swingin’ on the
day,&lt;br /&gt;
That Martha’s Addiction carried her away.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Hi, this is a standard text due to time constraints. 
On our this year USA travel we searched, found and logged this interesting cache. Today we had a trip from Eugene, thru the Cascades, and around the crater area with Belknap and Mt. Washington, then back to Eugene. On this tour we collected many nice caches. But in either case there were too many for a single day. So we collected these caches which were on or near our visited objects.  This was a good find and we had much fun in this special area and location. Especially the container is very remarquable! Many thanks to the Cache Owner for bringing us here and for the maintenance of this cache.

So, we postponed our adventure until we had time to research the route more thoroughly.  Today we approached from the south and were able to drive right to the cache site.  The last couple of miles were pretty rough and rocky, but certainly doable.  Although the cache hasn't been found for a few years, it was in good shape.  Thanks for getting us out into this area, which is recovering nicely from the burn.  T4TC.</groundspeak:text>

Great Theme for the cache.

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The listed coordinates are for the closest parking. Final coordinates, for those who qualify, are listed below.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sister Cities International&lt;/em&gt; (see website link above) was created at President Eisenhower’s 1956 White House conference on citizen diplomacy.  Eisenhower envisioned an organization that could be the hub of peace and prosperity by creating bonds between people from different cities around the world.  By becoming friends, President Eisenhower reasoned that people of different cultures could celebrate and appreciate their differences, instead of deriding them, fostering suspicion and sowing new seeds for war. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sister Cities International&lt;/em&gt; creates relationships based on cultural, educational, information and trade exchanges, creating lifelong friendships that provide prosperity and peace through person-to-person “citizen diplomacy.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In order to qualify for this Challenge cache, you must have found a cache in two sister cities-- one in a city in the US and one in its official sister city in another country. Any type of cache will be accepted. Please list the cities, GC#, cache names and dates found for each. The difficulty and terrain ratings reflect the intentionality and distance you have to travel to qualify. The actual cache is more like a 1.5/1.5&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;CL4BXMP - Cache location&lt;br /&gt;N 44° 18.029 W 121° 33.337&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Read description to see if you qualify.
Cache is by a bush under a 5 foot long log--at the listed final coordinates, not at the cache listing coordinates which are parking only.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Hope you see Wapiti!

**NOTE**
The elk ranch has closed its crop. If you do see wapiti its now a random chance. It is still a nice kodak moment.</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Hi, this is a standard text due to time constraints. 
On our this year USA travel we searched, found and logged this interesting cache. Today we had a trip from Eugene, thru the Cascades, and around the crater area with Belknap and Mt. Washington, then back to Eugene. On this tour we collected many nice caches. But in either case there were too many for a single day. So we collected these caches which were on or near our visited objects.  This was a good find and we had much fun in this special area and location. Many thanks to the Cache Owner for bringing us here and for the maintenance of this cache.

been teachers for a combination of 14 years, and as we drive by
these lava fields, we joke that this would be a terrible place for
30 Kindergartener's to go on a fieldtrip...can you imagine? So be
careful! You will want to park at the Viewpoint which is about 2
miles before the Dee Wright Observatory. You will want to watch
your step. The cache is not far off the beaten track. It will take
a keen eye...something like "Where's Waldo" in the sea of
lava.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Much of this area was formed fewer than 3,000 years ago. There
are a number of local volcanoes that are known as &lt;b&gt;shield
volcanoes&lt;/b&gt;, so named because they have regular lava eruptions
over the course of time, that eventually form a mountain in the
shape of an ancient shield. (Another description might be the shape
of a Vanilla Wafer!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an EarthCache, which is not a physical cache in any way.
To get credit for this, you will need to travel to the coordinates.
read the information sign, read this page, look around at the
natural formations, and think about your answers a bit. This
section of Oregon is part of the Cascade range of mountains, one of
the most active volcanic regions in the world. For thousands of
years, eruptions have consistently reshaped the landscape. Lava
refers both to molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption
and the resulting rock after solidification and cooling. This
molten rock is formed in the interior of some planets, including
Earth, and some of their satellites. When first erupted from a
volcanic vent, lava is a liquid at temperatures from 700 °C to
1,200 °C (1,300 °F to 2,200 °F). Up to 100,000 times as viscous as
water, lava can flow great distances before cooling and
solidifying, due to the properties of the molten rock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lava flow is a moving outpouring of lava, which is created
during a non-explosive effusive (pouring out) eruption. When it has
stopped moving, lava cools and solidifies to form igneous rock. The
word "lava" is Italian, and is probably derived from the Latin word
&lt;i&gt;labes&lt;/i&gt;, which means a fall or slide. The first use in
connection with extruded magma (molten rock from below the Earth's
surface) was apparently in an account written on the eruption of
Mt. Vesuvius in 1737, by the early geologist and scholar Francesco
Serao. Serao described "a flow of fiery lava" as an analogy to the
flow of boiling mud down the flanks of the volcano following heavy
rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Igneous rocks, which form lava flows when erupted, can be
classified into three basic chemical types; felsic, intermediate,
and mafic. The difference in these classes are primarily chemical;
but the chemistry of lava also tends to correlate with the magma
temperature, its viscosity and its mode of eruption. Here are the
three types:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Felsic lava&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Felsic (or silicic) lavas (such as rhyolite and dacite) typically
form lava spines, lava domes or "coulees" (which are thick, short
lavas) and are associated with pyroclastic (fragmental) deposits.
Most Silicic lava flows are extremely viscous, and typically
fragment as they extrude, producing blocky jagged clumps known as
autobreccias. The high viscosity and strength are the result of
their chemistry, which is high in silica, aluminium, potassium,
sodium, and calcium, forming a polymerized liquid rich in feldspar
and quartz, which thus has a higher viscosity than other magma
types. Felsic magmas can erupt at temperatures as low as 650 to 750
°C. Unusually hot (&amp;gt;950 °C) rhyolite lavas, however, may flow
for distances of many tens of miles, such as in the Snake River
Plain of the northwestern United States. The felsic autobreccias
are among the most difficult types of terrain on Earth, with spires
and crevasses often more than 10 meters (33 feet) in height.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Intermediate lava&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Intermediate or andesitic lavas are lower in aluminium and silica,
and usually somewhat richer in magnesium and iron. Intermediate
lavas form andesite domes and block lavas, and may occur on steep
composite volcanoes, such as in the Andes. Poorer in aluminium and
silica than felsic lavas, and also commonly hotter (in the range of
750 to 950 °C), they tend to be less viscous. Greater temperatures
tend to destroy polymerized bonds within the magma, promoting more
fluid behavior and also a greater tendency to form phenocrysts
(mixed or &amp;ldquo;spotty&amp;rdquo; rock formations). Intermediate lava
fields often resemble gravelly river beds, although the great lava
dome within the crater of Mt. St. Helens is comprised of
intermediate lava.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mafic lava&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Mafic or basaltic lavas are typified by their high content of
ferromagnesium (iron and magnesium), and generally erupt at
temperatures in excess of 950 °C. Basaltic magma also has a
relatively lower aluminium and silica content, which taken together
reduces the degree of polymerization within the melt. Owing to the
higher temperatures, viscosities can be relatively low, although
still thousands of times more viscous than water. Basalt lavas tend
to produce low-profile shield volcanoes or "flood basalt fields",
because the fluidal lava flows for long distances from the vent.
The thickness of a basalt lava, particularly on a low slope, may be
much greater than the thickness of the moving lava flow at any one
time, because basalt lavas may "inflate" by supply of lava beneath
a solidified crust. Most basalt lavas are of the &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo;ä
or pähoehoe types, rather than block lavas. Underwater they can
form "pillow lavas", which resemble soft bed pillows. This is the
smoothest of the three lava types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you see before you are three different lava flows, all
within the last 2,000 years. There are elements of all three types
of lava here, but you will have to look and read carefully to
determine the answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;To log this cache, you will need to email me the answers to
the following questions:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
1. What type of lava are you looking at here?&lt;br /&gt;
2. How many of the lava flows can you make out?&lt;br /&gt;
3. What are the colors of lava that you can see?&lt;br /&gt;
4. You are actually standing on a rock outcropping that continues
north, one that predates the lava flows. Look at the direction that
the lava was flowing, and describe in your own words what effect
the outcropping would have on the lava.&lt;br /&gt;
5. What populated areas would be most at risk from another eruption
here?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;And please be sure to include the name of the cache in your
email. After sending the email, go ahead and log the cache. I will
only contact you if there is a problem with your
answers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Hadn't done any research on caches in the area and iPhone wasn't getting any reception.  Stopped for lunch at the shelter and gave it a quick look.

Indian Ford Road is a favorite in this part of the ponderosa clad high desert near Black Butte.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Plan to spend an hour or so walking about these historic places.  The gate near the cache is open to all (please close the gate after you) so be sure to enter and browse the Farewells.  Don’t miss the visitors section of the Preserve with its historic barn as you return a few hundred yards toward the present.  Go early or late or take extra water.  Bring your camera(s).

The cache contains: The log and Geocache Information Form, a whale key chain, Kawasaki eraser, Little dog water cups (2), a bat, a yo-yo, a blue squirt gun, a blue whale squirt gun, pet rocks (2), a key cover, a new wrist watch, glow sticks (2), emergency EMS-SAR accident report form, no-trail-fees windshield stickers (2) and a MARS (military amateur radio service) button with pin attached.

Be careful to take main roads when returning or have a full tank of gas and a detailed road map.  Be mentally prepared for the possibility that you may have to return to the cache and start toward home again.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Hi, this is a standard text due to time constraints. 
On our this year USA travel we searched, found and logged this interesting cache. Today we had a trip from Eugene, thru the Cascades, and around the crater area with Belknap and Mt. Washington, then back to Eugene. On this tour we collected many nice caches. But in either case there were too many for a single day. So we collected these caches which were on or near our visited objects.  This was a good find and we had much fun in this special area and location. Many thanks to the Cache Owner for bringing us here and for the maintenance of this cache.

So I got off my horse and tied him to a tree and hunted really hard. My riding buddy who hasn't geocached before, was sitting on her horse eating a sandwich and she casually said, "I see a plastic container under that log over there." so that's how we found it. Btw there's a nasty dead tick in the container with all the treasures. TFTF. SLTNLS

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">                  A little History

Camp Polk was established in 1865 adjacent to Squaw Creek, just three miles northeast of the City of Sisters. The military detachment, which established the camp, were men of Company A, 1st Oregon Volunteer Infantry, commanded by Captain Charles LaFollette. Leaving Ft. Yamhill, this was the first military group to cross the Cascades via the new Santiam Road. Upon arriving at the site adjacent to Squaw Creek, Captain LaFollette named the camp Polk after his home country. Here the men prepared a parade ground, trimmed a tall tree for a flagpole and built eight cabins. Before winter operations could be initiated against the Indians, word was received from the Chief of the Army to muster out all volunteers. Subsequently, the Camp Polk detachment remained in winter quarters and in the spring of 1866 returned to their home, thus ending the brief military history of Camp Polk.

During 1879, Samuel M.W. Hindman and his family homesteaded the Camp Polk site. In 1875, Hindman established a post office and a store and became the community's first postmaster. At this time, the area between the Cascades and the Deschutes River was virtually uninhabited, but destined to bustle with the future movement of cattle and sheep over the Santiam Pass.(from the City of Sisters Comprehensive Plan 1999 Update (draft), Appendix C, and edited by Eric Porter)

It was a delight to see it all, and impressed that the cemetery is still being used.

Wandered around, found the correct residents and did our calculations.   At ground zero, the gps decided to bounce around - but we quickly found the cache which was exposed.  We left it a bit better covered.

We enjoyed reading about the history of this place too.  thanks!

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">What an interesting cemetery.  Gets a fav point for location!  It was VERY hot when we were doing this cache.  Our 7 yr old granddaughter was with us and trying to stand in the shade while we were walking around looking for each stage.  There is a 3 sided shed and she was standing next to it when she noticed there was some stuff in there including plastic flowers by the open door.  She bent down to touch the flowers and heard rattles going off and looked and saw a snake moving.  She screamed and ran to us, and sure enough when we approached the shed we too could hear the rattlesnake shaking it's booty.  Just an FYI to future cachers t to be aware and on the look out!

Make this a 3 cache day by adding Whoosh and Eden to your agenda while in the area. And if you have little kids, quarters are useful in the local attraction!
   Be sure to enjoy the huge Pondy Pine near the cache...</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">
Original contents include:

Waterproof matches
Fishing lure lites
Can opener
Play sticks
Playing cards
Tricky little sewing kit
and more.....
Cache is in a smallish ammo can so plan accordingly.
