</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;For the last 10 years I’ve been volunteering with the U.S. Geological Survey as a field assistant to help with the mapping of Newberry Volcano.  This series of caches replaces the old Split Butte Fissure multi-cache.  Split Butte is an informal name that we use for an old silicic dome. The name comes from the fact that there is a young basaltic fissure which cuts across the western edge of the dome. The fissure is now known as the Split Butte Fissure. Previous geologic mapping had indicated that these flows were pre-Mazama in age (greater than 7,700 years old). The Split Butte Fissure was recently (2012) added  to the NW Rift Eruptive Episode (7,000 years old) because my fieldwork showed that it overlies Mazama tephra. In addition, recent work by USGS scientists showed that Split Butte Fissure lavas overlap in chemical composition and paleomagnetic direction with data for the NW Rift. The fissure system extends intermittently for 2.3 miles roughly north-south. The fissure system can be divided into 8 segments ranging from 0.05 to 0.22 miles long with the longest gap being 0.80 miles. This cache series includes caches in 5 of the 8 fissure segments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is located in fissure segment #3 at the north end of the system. This segment is about 0.08 miles long and contains a large crater at the south end of a chain of spatter vents (about a half dozen). Low in the walls of the large crater are exposers of the basalt flows from Topso Butte, which this segment erupted through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is in a pill bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

The northern end of this segment is on basalt flows from a vent associated with Jack Butte while the southern end is on basaltic andesite flows from Kweo Butte. Within the spatter deposits accidental blocks of both of these rock types can be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is in a plastic jar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cache is located in fissure segment #2 at the north end of the system. This segment is a single large crater about 200 feet in diameter. This crater appears to be an explosion crater resulting from the  interaction of the magma with groundwater producing a steam explosion. The walls of the crater expose outcrops of the basalt flows from Topso Butte, which this segment erupted through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is in a pill bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cache is located in fissure segment #1 at the north end of the system. This segment is about 0.15 miles long and contains at least 6 vents. This segment also produced a small lava flow to the west which contains some tree molds. The cache is located near the rim of the largest crater. In the walls of some of the northern craters of this segment are large outcrops of the tuff of Split Butte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cache is in the original plastic container from the old Split Butte Fissure multi-cache.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This cache is located on the south side of Newberry Volcano at an elevation of about 6,150 feet.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">For the last few years I’ve been volunteering with the U.S. Geological Survey as a field assistant to help with the mapping of Newberry Volcano.  One of the items of work has been to climb many of the cinder cones and collect a sample for chemistry.  The summits of many of the cones have had interesting features, nice old growth ponderosa pine, and have provided great views. 

Rim Butte is located on the south side of Newberry. The cone is 200 to 400 feet high depending on which side you decide to climb. The cone has a crater that is about 800 feet wide and 100 feet deep and is partly rimmed with agglutinate (welded spatter).  The best views are from the west side of the rim but it is well worth the time to walk all the way around the crater rim.  Views include Mt. Scott and Llao Roct at Crater Lake, Mt. Theilsen, Diamond Peak, Paulina Peak, and the Fort Rock Basin.

The cache is a plastic container covered with duct tape.</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Volcanoguy's cache locations always amaze me and he didn't let me down on this one.  The climb is definitely worth the effort but I usually have a 163" track and an 800cc engine under me when I climb hills this steep.  I managed to get my trail bike within 2/10 of a mile but don't underestimate that last 2/10, that is one steep hill in hiking boots.  My GPS'r had GZ about 30' west of the hiding spot but the clue is a dead giveaway.  It was a hazy day off to the west but could still see as far south as Mt. Scott to the south.  Thanks for another great one Volcanoguy!

We were grateful for the hints since our GPSrs were often 40 - 60 feet off the posted coords when we finally located the cache.

Be forewarned -- your vehicle will get scratched on the TL series.  Kestrel Ridge's rig had superficial scratches; our truck, being full-sized, was not so lucky.  You will reach a point where there is no place to turn around or turn back.

That being said, we found all but one of the TL caches.  Glad to be done!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6;"&gt;For the last nine years I’ve been volunteering with the U.S. Geological Survey during the summer as a field assistant to help with the geologic mapping of Newberry Volcano. Today, I was working the area between The Dome and Weasel Butte. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weasel  Butte is a 350 foot high cinder cone from which lava flowed more than 11 miles SE through Lava Pass on Road 18.  The butte is one of a number of undated  vents which are estimated to be in the 8,000 to 20,000 year old range. Weasel Butte is younger than Cinder Cone (to SE) and older than The Dome (to NW). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The starting point to reach Weasel Butte is your choice. Not all roads shown on the geocaching maps are passable by vehicles (badly overgrown).  The cache is small green plastic container with room for a few small trade items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Be forewarned -- your vehicle will get scratched on the TL series.  Kestrel Ridge's rig had superficial scratches; our truck, being full-sized, was not so lucky.  You will reach a point where there is no place to turn around or turn back.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Challenge your brain and enjoy a long distance view!  Solve some puzzles and climb a small butte in a lesser-used area of the Deschutes National Forest.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is a 3-stage multicache in a multi-use section of the forest.  There is an ice cave with picnic area and a network of ATV trails within a few miles.  THE ABOVE COORDINATES ARE FOR A NEARBY ROAD INTERSECTION, AND NOT FOR THE FIRST STAGE.  To get the coordinates of each stage, you need to solve the puzzles below.  The containers at the intermediate stages provide some of the information necessary to solve the later puzzles.  However, some advance thinking and preparation could considerably reduce the time spent solving the puzzles at the cache site.

The hides are not particularly difficult.  The rating is largely based on the puzzles.  The terrain rating takes into consideration the fact there are no trails in the area and there is a steep climb involved.  There is a way to get to the top of the butte without constantly climbing over loose rock.  Also, it is NOT necessary to travel through a reforestation area with protected tree seedlings.  The total walking distance for this adventure is less than a mile.  You will need to do a little climbing on some rocks, so be careful and be sure to test your footing in the rocky areas.  Some of the area is treeless, so you may want to bring sunscreen.

Directions:
From the south end of the town of La Pine, turn east on Finley Butte Road (Forest Road 22) and travel about 21 miles on this paved road to the above coordinates.  At this point, turn left on the dirt road (2200-520) and look for a place to park.  The first few hundred feet of this road are suitable even for a small car.

Coordinates for the first stage container (a round Altoids tin):
   N 43° 34.144
   W 121° 08.AA9
where AA is the answer to the following puzzle:

Three geocaching buddies, Manny, Moe, and Jack, who like to compete for FTF (first-to-find) honors, and together have exactly 100 FTFs among them, are discussing an exotic new cache they all plan to hunt.  Manny says, "If I find this cache first, I will increase my lead over both of you."  Moe adds, "But if I find it first, then I will have exactly half as many FTFs as Manny has."  Jack then says "And if I find it first, then my total of FTFs will be 30% of Moe's."  If Manny finds the cache first, how many FTFs will he then have?  Answer = AA.

THE FIRST STAGE CONTAINER CONTAINS A "MAGIC NUMBER" THAT WILL BE USED IN THE NEXT PUZZLE.  IT ALSO CONTAINS "MAGIC PHRASE 1" THAT WILL BE USED FOR THE FINAL PUZZLE.

Coordinates for the second stage container (a small round container):
   N 43° 34.130
   W 121° 08.BB5
where BB is the answer to the following puzzle:

Identify a two-digit mystery number using the following clues:
  1) The mystery number is a prime number, which means it is evenly divisible only by itself and the number 1.
  2) The sum of the two digits of the mystery number is greater than the MAGIC NUMBER.
  3) If you reverse the mystery number's digits, and multiply this new number by the MAGIC NUMBER, the result is less than 175.
  4) If you subtract the MAGIC NUMBER from the mystery number, the result is a number that is evenly divisible by 4.
  What is the mystery number?  Answer = BB.

THE SECOND STAGE CONTAINER CONTAINS "MAGIC PHRASE 2" THAT WILL BE USED FOR THE FINAL PUZZLE.

Coordinates for the cache (a 7x11 inch plastic container):
   N 43° 34.CC4
   W 121° 08.DD3
where CC and DD are obtained by solving the puzzle below:

Combine all the letters found in MAGIC PHRASE 1 and MAGIC PHRASE 2 and rearrange (anagram) the whole bunch to spell the names of four well-known U.S. cities.  Each city has a population of at least 500,000.  You will use all the letters; none will be left over.  Don't bother to analyze the original phrases for any clues or meaning; there is none.  Once you have formed the names of the four cities, make a list of them in alphabetical order.
  CC = the total number of letters in the names of the first three cities on the list.
  DD = the number of letters in the name of the fourth city, multiplied by 9.

Allow plenty of time for this adventure.  This type of challenge is most enjoyable when you are not pressed for time.  Original cache contents include a new Shrek 2 watch, a basic, working digital watch, a 1-ringgit Malaysian coin, a Narada CD (easy listening), a Chinese music CD, a sheet of colorful "Coral Reef" postage stamps, a stuffed bunny, and, of course, a logbook.  Have fun!</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Stage 1: This is a real stumper, isn't it?
Stage 2: As they say in the UK, this could make you go crackers.

Having just finished up Sea Flyer's X series, we embarked on these TL caches.  We were grateful for the hints since our GPSrs were often 40 - 60 feet off the posted coords when we finally located the cache.

Be forewarned -- your vehicle will get scratched on the TL series.  Kestrel Ridge's rig had superficial scratches; our truck, being full-sized, was not so lucky.  You will reach a point where there is no place to turn around or turn back.

That being said, we found all but one of the TL caches.  Glad to be done!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Stroll on up the old skid road - If you can find it - and work your way around to the cache. When we where there we had some nice views of East Butte, China Hat, Fort Rock, Sugar Pine Ridge and a lot of the Cascade peaks - from Mt. Scott to North Sister and plenty of places in between.

Your looking for another one of those 6 quart plastic boxes painted greenish with a logbook and several goodies in it.  Remember to sign the logbook and trade items if you want. The view is the reason and the cache is the carrot to get you out here.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I decided to take advantage of this beautiful day to see if I could get to this cache and finally cross it off my list of "must do" caches.  It's been over three years since anyone has found it, so I thought it could use some company anyway.  I couldn't get as close as I wanted to because there is quite a bit of snow on the roads out there.  I was pushing snow with my front axle when I remembered some advice a wise man recently gave me on Pine Mt.  He said "drive until you have to put on chains...then turn around and go the other way."

I decided to hike in from the 21 road and as it turns out, it wasn't a bad way to go.  It was still a fairly steep climb, but the snow was the perfect depth and consistency to form steps as I went.  Once I got to the top, I crossed over to where the cache is and there was very little snow there.  It was a beautiful place to sit and catch my breath, and probably one of the best view to climb ratios I've ever seen.  Thanks for another great cache Logscaler &amp; Red!

The cache is in very good condition and contains some pretty good swag.  I took the calculator so I wouldn't have to do math on paper any more and left a nice little led flashlight.</groundspeak:text>

While I was up there, I called Mac at East Butte and gave him a mirror flash to let him know where I was. Cache # 750 in 4 years, 10 months of geocaching. Took the padlock and left a Zachary Taylor gold dollar and my card. TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well we decided to end our camping week with a traditional easy cache, so we found the coords for a Logscaler and Red placement for the UPlifting experience. We came in from the back, east, south, southeast side, then we parked the rigs at the bottom of another short hike. Only .14 miles acording to our GPSr. We headed to the west then we found ourselves going north for awhile, then we switched back again to the south and southeast. Switched back again to the northwest and made a radical easterly turn for the rest of the walk. Found it! Right where we figured it would be when we first parked our rigs. Had a good time.
Cache is in good shape.

From La Pine, go south on Hwy 97, turn left on Finley Butte Rd (which turns into National Forest Rd 22), follow signs to the cave location&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While here, don't forget to find the traditional, "No Iceman Here" Cache (&lt;a class="CoordInfoLink" href="http://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCXA10_no-iceman-here#"&gt;GCXA10&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">At the posted coordinates is an excellent example of an ice cave.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An ice cave is a naturally formed underground cavity in the ice, or an underground cave that has permanent ice deposits. These two types of ice caves are unrelated.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first type of ice cave is formed by meltwater streams carving labyrinths in the bases of glaciers, or by streams and wind hollowing out tunnels in snowfields. These usually have scalloped, translucent walls that transmit a blue light.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The second type of ice cave occurs when frigid winter air settles into downward-leading caverns where it cannot be forced out, or when moisture freezes in currents of cold air. Frozen icicles, ice draperies, and lakes are common formations. Helictite-like icicles also form where air currents deflect the freezing water.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Grounds are open year around. However, cave is closed from October 14 - April 1st.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To log this as a find, please e-mail me the answers to the questions below. Do not post them in your log. Also, posting a picture of you or your group would be appreciated but not required.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Is this ice cave type 1 or type 2?&lt;br /&gt;
What is the temperature at the cave entrance versus temperature at the parking area?&lt;br /&gt;
What is the elevation at the cave entrance? Estimate how deep the cave descends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This can't possibly still be Planet Earth!  The un-Earthly landscape and the views make the short hike up the steep hill more than worth the effort.  Look for Fort Rock to the southeast and East lake to the north.  There is a well worn trail to the top that starts at GC159EQ.  This one can usually be found in the winter time because the winds usually don't let much snow accumulate at the cache site ... but be extra careful near the east edge of the rim as the cornice can get quite large.  You are looking for an ammo can with all the usual stuff. Congrats to sunriverfab4 for FTF ... and thanks for the fav point!

Having just finished up Sea Flyer's X series, we embarked on these TL caches.  We were grateful for the hints since our GPSrs were often 40 - 60 feet off the posted coords when we finally located the cache.

Be forewarned -- your vehicle will get scratched on the TL series.  Kestrel Ridge's rig had superficial scratches; our truck, being full-sized, was not so lucky.  You will reach a point where there is no place to turn around or turn back.

That being said, we found all but one of the TL caches.  Glad to be done!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The first stage is a micro and you should be able to park really close to it.  Second stage will take you about a 1/2 mile hike up a well worn trail to a small camoed container full of little toys etc.  It's well worth the short hike; the view is spectacular! Be careful with the munchkins at the top. My young boys made it with no problem!
Based on the location and elevation of this cache, I'm assuming it will only be accessible in the summer months.  Please replace both caches as found.

Will try to get back later this week to work on the two loops I didn't get to today. Knew I wouldn't get them all done today, so left about half for next trip. TFTH. SL</groundspeak:text>

Having just finished up Sea Flyer's X series, we embarked on these TL caches.  We were grateful for the hints since our GPSrs were often 40 - 60 feet off the posted coords when we finally located the cache.

Be forewarned -- your vehicle will get scratched on the TL series.  Kestrel Ridge's rig had superficial scratches; our truck, being full-sized, was not so lucky.  You will reach a point where there is no place to turn around or turn back.

That being said, we found all but one of the TL caches.  Glad to be done!</groundspeak:text>

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;For the last ten years I&amp;rsquo;ve been volunteering with the U.S. Geological Survey during the summer as a field assistant to help with the geologic mapping of Newberry Volcano. Today, we made an off trail hike to a hill (7183) on the upper east flank of Newberry. There are some limited views from the summit including The Dome, Sand Butte, and Red Hill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tephra Hill is our unofficial name for this hill. The hill was buried by at least 4 feet of tephra from the eruption of the Big Obsidian Flow 1300 years ago which occurred 3.5 miles to the WSW. The hill would also have been buried by about 2 feet of tephra from the eruption of Mt. Mazama to form Crater Lake 7700 years ago. The location is high and exposed so winds have totally removed the BOF and Mazama tephras from a small area on the upper south flank of the hill. The same thing has happened on The Dome and Red Hill to expose the red cinders of cinder cones. At this location the wind exposed an even older tephra deposit related to the formation of Newberry caldera about 75,000 years ago. Also exposed on the summit are large rounded boulders of several rock types which may be of glacial origin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The route is your choice, some are better than others.&amp;nbsp; The cache is a small red plastic container with room for a few small trade items.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;For the last eight years I’ve been volunteering with the U.S. Geological Survey during the summer as a field assistant to help with the geologic mapping of Newberry Volcano. Today, I was working along the Crater Rim &amp;amp; Lost Lake Trails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is located near the rim of the Big Obsidian vent crater, where there is a great view of the vent dome from which the Big Obsidian Flow originated. The Big Obsidian eruption occurred in three phases. The eruption began with an gas-rich explosive eruption which formed a crater and a large tephra plume extending eastward. The plume is easily identifiable near Brothers on Hwy 20 but has been identified in lake deposits in Idaho. During the second less explosive phase a large ashflow went northward into Paulina Lake, which can viewed in the road cuts along the road between the Newberry Group Camp and Little Crater Campground. During the final phase the degassed magma reached the surface and flowed northward.  From this cache location the dome over the eruptive vent is visible from the vent crater rim.&lt;/p&gt;

There is an abandoned trail on the west and south sides that is now marked as a snowmobile route--indeed, we found many scarred logs, machine parts and beer cans. The hike involved a little scrambling at the top of the flow but was mostly on pumice soil at the scenic interface between flow and forest. Very peaceful with no other people. 

We joined the Lost Lake Trail near this cache. Enjoyed the view and description of the dome which we could see from other angles during our hike. Thanks!</groundspeak:text>

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;For the last eight years I’ve been volunteering with the U.S. Geological Survey during the summer as a field assistant to help with the geologic mapping of Newberry Volcano. Today, I was working the east rim of Newberry caldera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is located on a spatter rim overlooking the largest crater in the southern segment of the East Rim Fissure which erupted about 11,000 years ago. The southern segment is heavily mantled by tephra from the Big Obsidian Flow eruption, about 28 inches thick here, but has been removed from this steep slope by the wind. There is also a view of north rim of the caldera from here.&lt;/p&gt;

We were amazed at the number of damaged trees as evidence of crashes by these machines.  Spent a few minutes at GZ, admiring the mossy trees and was glad the edge was secure.  Thanks for the geology lesson.  Trail 4 or the north rim bike trail does not have the large mountain hemlocks that are plentiful on the south rim trail, hence there is very little shade to protect the hikers.

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;For the last eight years I’ve been volunteering with the U.S. Geological Survey during the summer as a field assistant to help with the geologic mapping of Newberry Volcano. Today, I was working along the south Rim Trail and stopped to visit a previously described tephra site near high point 7628. Tephra is air fall deposits from a volcanic eruption. The nearby tephra site exposes a lithic (bedrock fragments broken up by eruption) rich pumice fall related to the early phases of the Big Obsidian eruption (about 1,300 years ago) which overlies Mazama Pumice from Crater Lake eruption (about 7,700 years ago), which overlies fine grained tephra from the caldera forming eruption (about 80,000 years ago).  In addition to the tephra exposure there is a great view of Newberry Caldera.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache container is 2” x 3” box with a short pencil and a few small items, but you might want to bring your own pen.&lt;/p&gt;

Having just finished up Sea Flyer's X series, we embarked on these TL caches.  We were grateful for the hints since our GPSrs were often 40 - 60 feet off the posted coords when we finally located the cache.

Be forewarned -- your vehicle will get scratched on the TL series.  Kestrel Ridge's rig had superficial scratches; our truck, being full-sized, was not so lucky.  You will reach a point where there is no place to turn around or turn back.

That being said, we found all but one of the TL caches.  Glad to be done!</groundspeak:text>

I wonder how a lot of GC are so rarely found around here !!!

In my old Europe :) GC are found very often and it is a kind of race to be FTF ;-D
Even in deep forests or difficult to reach places...

Anyway, thanks again to all owners In the State where it all belonged !</groundspeak:text>

Be forewarned -- your vehicle will get scratched on the TL series.  Kestrel Ridge's rig had superficial scratches; our truck, being full-sized, was not so lucky.  You will reach a point where there is no place to turn around or turn back.

I wonder how a lot of GC are so rarely found around here !!!

In my old Europe :) GC are found very often and it is a kind of race to be FTF ;-D
Even in deep forests or difficult to reach places...

Anyway, thanks again to all owners In the State where it all belonged !

In and out : nothing ! But another favourite : I love the place :)</groundspeak:text>

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;For the last eight years I’ve been volunteering with the U.S. Geological Survey during the summer as a field assistant to help with the geologic mapping of Newberry Volcano. Today, I was working the east rim of Newberry caldera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is located on a spatter rim overlooking a large crater at the southern end of the middle segment of the East Rim Fissure which erupted about 11,000 years ago. The middle segment has a thinner mantle of tephra from the Big Obsidian Flow eruption, about 8 inches thick here, but has been removed from this steep slope by the wind. There is a great view of the caldera from here, including the dome in SE corner of the caldera, Paulina Peak, Diamond Peak (Cascades), Little Crater, Central Pumice Cone, Interlake Flow, East Lake, East Lake Fissure, and the north caldera rim.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This is a five stage multi-cache high on the south flank of Newberry Volcano below Paulina Peak. The general area was formerly accessed by the old South Paulina Peak trail which no longer exists.  The challenge of this cache is the distance and terrain you must cross, plan on hiking at least 4 miles, mostly cross country but there are a few overgrown road segments that might help in some areas.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">As I’ve indicated on a number of my recent caches I’ve been working as a volunteer for the U.S. Geological Survey as a field assistant to the geologist mapping Newberry Volcano. This multi-cache follows the route of our work for one day. 

One item in a day’s work is the collection of rock samples for chemistry and the intermediate waypoints of this cache are at or near sample sites.  Many of the rocks of Newberry Volcano look very similar in hand samples so the chemistry of the rocks allows us to distinguish flows from different sources. In addition many older lava flows cannot be directly mapped back to their source because portions of the flow have been buried by younger deposits.  In some cases if the source of the flow has not been buried the chemistry of the vent can be matched to the chemistry of the flow.

The starting point is at an old road intersection that is currently still accessible if you have a high clearance vehicle and you don’t mind the brush, if not you will probably want to park along F.S. Rd. 2225 at the point where F.S. Rd. 2225 500 begins and hike up to this old road junction (about an additional 0.3 miles).  Be sure to mark the location of your rig if you do not park at the starting point, it might save you some walking on the return to your rig.

Waypoint A - Starting Point - N  43° 40.000’   W 121° 16.256’
At the junction you will find a sign for the 505 road, behind this sign are two Ponderosa pines.  As an example of what you are looking for, the first marker is located between these trees at the base of the closest one.  The markers are 1” aluminum tags with a number on them that you will use to calculate the final cache location.  You need to recorded the number on each tag and which waypoint it was at.  No effort has been made to hide the tags, but they may become covered. 

Waypoint B -  N  43° 40.303’     W  121° 16.485’
This waypoint point is at a sample site on an old cinder cone largely buried in a steep slope. In addition to the many young cinder cones that dot the surface of Newberry Volcano there are also many older cones that have been partially buried by younger deposits.

Waypoint C -   N  43° 40.362’   W  121° 16.273’
This waypoint is at a sample site in a welded ash-flow tuff. Welded tuffs like this are related to large caldera forming eruptions. Currently three different large eruptions are known, hopefully this sample will allow us to correlate this deposit to one of these eruptions.

Waypoint D  -  N  43° 40.383    W  121° 15.900’
This wayoint is at a sample site on a dacitic lava flow. This dacitec flow appears to be the youngest feature you will visit today, but is still more than 80,000 years old.

Waypoint E -   N  43° 40.174’    W  121° 16.059’
The fifth point is near an air-fall pumice deposit which we believe to be related to the ash-flow tuff at Point #3

Cache Location -  N 43°  40.XXX       W 121°  15.YYY
The cache is located near a sample site on another old buried cinder cone.

XXX = E-B+32
YYY = D-A+C-69

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Drove over from Prineville this morning to find this cache that has been out way too long with no finders.  Knew it would be a fun one and I wasn't dissappointed.  Parked on the 2225 road and walked to the starting point, even with that walk I only went 3.1 miles round trip.  Only had one stretch of manzanita to get through on the way to "B", and quite a bit of down lodgepole during the remaining wp's.  The best wp was "E", loved those pondo pines mixed in with the lodgepole's and had good views from there.  Was only 32 degree's when I left the rig but warmed up in the 1:40 minutes it took to get back to the rig.   Had to use most of the hints to find the wp's, but didn't have to look very long for any of them (and they are easy to read).  Thanks for a nice multi.  T4TH</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Cache along the Crater Rim Trail.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;For the last eight years I’ve been volunteering with the U.S. Geological Survey during the summer as a field assistant to help with the geologic mapping of Newberry Volcano. Today, I was working along the Crater Rim &amp;amp; Lost Lake Trails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years we’ve made a number of hikes in the steep country south of Paulina Peak and have come across several segments of the old abandoned South Paulina Peak Trail which began from Rd. 2225 near the start of GC1WB5R - A Geologist’s Day. This cache is located near the upper end of the trail where it joined the Crater Rim Trail. The first lookout on Paulina Peak was built in 1915 and this was the only access trail to the peak until the mid 1930s when the CCC’s competed a new road to Paulina Lake and development of a campground and guard station began. A new trail was then built from the guard Station the lookout. The road to Paulina Peak was constructed in 1958 by the Air Force to build a radar station. The lookout on Paulina Peak was removed in 1968. The location of the old South Paulina Peak Trail shows on the 1963 Paulina Peak topographic map. Lack of use resulted in the trail being closed and rehabbed in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Area could be restricted in the winter due to snow.  This is fairly easy terrain. There are several other caches in the surrounding area, so be sure to check the maps thoroughly.</groundspeak:long_description>

Anyway, thanks again to all owners In the State where it all belonged !

Having just finished up Sea Flyer's X series, we embarked on these TL caches.  We were grateful for the hints since our GPSrs were often 40 - 60 feet off the posted coords when we finally located the cache.

Be forewarned -- your vehicle will get scratched on the TL series.  Kestrel Ridge's rig had superficial scratches; our truck, being full-sized, was not so lucky.  You will reach a point where there is no place to turn around or turn back.

That being said, we found all but one of the TL caches.  Glad to be done!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;For the last eight years I’ve been volunteering with the U.S. Geological Survey during the summer as a field assistant to help with the geologic mapping of Newberry Volcano. Today, I was working the caldera floor along the Newberry Crater Trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is located on a rim of palagonite tuff about a tenth of a mile north of the trail. Palagonite is the result of a basaltic eruption in the presence of abundant water. Without the water the eruption would have formed a cinder cone but instead a tuff cone or tuff ring is formed. The presence of the water results in an explosive eruption. The eruption produces a loose muddy deposit of rock fragments and volcanic glass. Over a few years the volcanic glass alters to palagonite which cements the deposit together. Take some time to wander around looking at the deposits and the views which include the East Lake Obsidian Flow, the SE Rim Dome, the south rim, Paulina Peak, and the vent dome for the South Obsidian Flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near this cache is a lone Juniper tree that seems Out OF Place here.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The starting coordinates will put near the interpretive sign at the summit of Paulina Peak, which is a Recreation Fee Site requiring a parking pass.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is the second in a series of eight Earthcaches being developed at major points of interest in Newberry National Volcanic Monument in cooperation with the staff of the Deschutes National Forest. The summit is usually accessible from early-July to late-October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To claim this Earthcache you need to post a photo(s) of your favorite view(s) from the summit area and email me the answers to the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supply the missing words in the following statement "Newberry lies ????????????? overlapping fault zones" from the interpretive sign at the parking area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the highest point count the number of rocky knobs visible on the surface of Paulina Peak flow;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coordinates for the highest point, mark a waypoint in your GPS;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Along the road on the way down stop at the group of rocky knobs and using your GPS what is the distance and heading (from True North) to the highest point (#3).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While doing this earthcache you may also be able to collect the necessary information to claim several waymarks in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

While Newberry only rises about 3,600 feet above the surrounding area, it covers an area in excess of 500 square miles (an oval area 25 miles east-west by 40 miles north-south) and has a volume of over 110 cubic miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://imgcdn.geocaching.com/cache/large/b3b58272-a1db-4fca-b961-06d06ae3f469.jpg" alt="Caldera view from Paulina Peak" width="225" height="142" border="0" align="left" /&gt;Paulina Peak is located on the southwest rim of Newberry Crater, the 17 square mile caldera at the summit of Newberry Volcano. This peak is a large rhyolite flow which formed about 83,000 years ago, shortly before the large eruption which resulted in the formation of Newberry Crater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the summit of Paulina Peak there is a marvelous 360-degree view. To the west, from north to south the view includes the Cascades from Mt. Adams in Washington to Mt. Shasta in California. From south to east the view is into the Basin &amp;amp; Range Province. From east to north the view is largely the interior of Newberry Crater. Below are bearing and distance to some of the more obvious features.&lt;/p&gt;

#2 of the Day in Oregon

Today we Visited the Newberry NVM and the crater lake NP from our Hotel base in Bend.

In Perfect Sunny and warm weather this was such a Great day and not really Knowing what to Expect from the Parks we were so delighted of the Things they offered to see!

Back from Lava cast Forest next thing we did was Driving up the lake Road and the dirt Road to the summit. The view was so great. Answered the questions and went on to obsidian Flow.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Cache off the Newberry Crater Trail south of East Lake.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;For the last eight years I’ve been volunteering with the U.S. Geological Survey during the summer as a field assistant to help with the geologic mapping of Newberry Volcano. Today, I was working the caldera floor along the Newberry Crater Trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is located at a small feature about a tenth of a mile south of the trail. You are searching for a small depression about 50 feet in diameter and 6 feet deep. There are a number of these small depressions scattered around in surficial deposits in and near the caldera. Without Lidar (light radar - generally uses equipment mounted in a plane that illuminates the ground with a laser and analyzes the reflected light to produce a detailed aerial image of the ground) these features would be unrecognized. At this location there are two possible causes. The underlying obsidian flow is covered by a thick blanket of tephra (airfall eruptive material). One possibility is that a low area on the flow was full of snow at the time of the tephra eruption and that as the snow later melted the overlying tephra collapse to form the depression. The other possibility is that there was some sort of a cavity (system of cracks and voids) in the flow that was bridged over by the tephra deposit. Over time the finer material in the tephra has moved down into the cavity resulting in the depression.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The source for the geology lesson on this Earthcache is "Roadside Guide to the geology and history of Newberry Volcano." by Robert Jensen (aka Volcanoguy).
The Newberry Volcano lies at the western end of High Lava Plains province of Oregon. A large number of rhyolite domes and flows occur throughout the length of the High Lava Plains province. 
Newberry Volcano is among the largest Quaternary volcanoes in the lower 48 states. It covers an oval area 20 miles east-west by 30 miles north-south in excess of 500 square miles.
The flank flows of this volcano can be divided into two groups based on their age their age relative to the 7600 year old Mazama ash that  originated from present day Crater Lake National Park.
The youngest flows overlie the Mazama Ash and were erupted over a short period of time about 7000 years ago.
The older flows are covered by Mazama Ash; surface features suggest a relatively young age (9 to 15 thousand years) compared to  some that are over 100 thousand years old. A significant number of the hills on Newberry's flanks are rhyolitic domes.  In addition pumice rings, obsidian flows and small rhyolite or obsidian protrusions occur in many places.
Ash falls, pumice falls, mud flows and other pyroclastic deposits are common on the east and west flanks of Newberry.
From the Glossary: Ash - Fine pyroclastic material formed during volcanic eruptions - smaller than lapilli
Ash Flow - A turbulent mixture of gas and pyroclastic materials of high temperature, ejected explosively from a crater or fissure, that travels swiftly down the slopes of a volcano or along the ground surface.
Ash flow tuff - The consolidated deposits of volcanic ash resulting from an ash flow.
Basalt - a dark fine grained igneous rock with a low silica content of less than 52% and rich in iron and magnesium.
Lapilli - Volcanic ejecta ranging in size from 2 mm to 64 mm -  larger than ash.
Magma - Molten rock below the earth's surface in a high pressure environment. Magma contains many dissolved gasses held in solution by the high confining pressures. 
Obsidian - Black to clear volcanic glass from a lava flow or dome with a high silica content. The black color is due to abundant microscopic crystals of magnetite (a dark iron oxide).
Pumice - Light colored pieces of volcanic rock so full of vesicles that they will often float on water. Most pumice is violently thrown out of volcanoes by expanding gasses. Composition ranges from dacite to rhyolite.
Silica - The chemical combination of silicon and oxygen.
Vent - The opening at the earth's surface through which volcanic materials issue.
Welded tuff - Rock formed of volcanic ash fused by its own heat following an eruption.

The 2 rocks that you have to identify are  next to a tall burned stump 
The questions: What is the rock to the left of the stump?  Would this rock float in a bucket of water?
What is the light colored stone stuck in the crack in the stump?  Would this stone float in a bucket of water?
What else about the geology of the south side of Paulina did you learn on your hike ?
Contact me through my profile with the answers to my questions      If you do not have a high clearance vehicle you may have to walk up the 0 .3 mile 500 road to the first waypoint of GC1WB5R at the intersection with the 505 road.

Good thing because after parking at the 500/505 intersection we noticed large animal tracks in the road (bear are in the caldera so maybe yogi was here) and we felt better having 3 people in our group. 
Followed the road until we were within 0.23 then headed uphill. Interesting terrain, we loved the adventure and the scenery. Thanks for the earth cache, you ex-forest service guys know how to make them fun and educational!</groundspeak:text>

Stayed on the 500 road until I was about .2 from the cache, where two big pondos have fallen across the road.  Went up the bank and walked to the stump, it wasn't too steep and there were only a few down falls to cross.  It was just over a one mile walk to the cache and coming back I dropped down the hill where the road made a switchback and it was just under a mile coming back.  Couldn't see much as the lodgepole is pretty thick.  Thanks for putting this one out.  T4TH</groundspeak:text>

Maybe you will see what I was looking for in the summer.
Try to stay out of hot water while in this area.
Thanks to Volcanoguy, you should be able to find the wellcap for the 3058 foot deep geothermal well that is over 500 degrees F. at the bottom.  Waypoint added 9/17/07.

Got a great night's sleep in the Jeep, so we're off to get more caches. Glorieme and I are off with MsSkarlet and two finders keepers along with five dogs and two Jeeps for a great adventure around Oregon. We are on a 9 day journey to find caches in counties, on DeLorme pages, at fire towers, in cemeteries, and a bunch of places in between. Thought we'd get any webcams, virtuals, and earthcaches along the way. 

Our goal today was to get a couple of the ECs up here and visit the top of Paulina Peak. After getting the info for the ECs, we grabbed this one, too. Nice to add this one to the LOT bookmark. TFTH.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The starting coordinates will put you in the parking area for the Big Obsidian Flow, which is a Recreation Fee Site requiring a parking pass. The area is usually accessable from early-June to mid-November.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is the third in a series of eight earthcaches being developed at major points of interest in Newberry National Volcanic Monument in cooperation with the staff of the Deschutes National Forest. This earthcache is located along a nearly one mile paved/crushed rock trail with stairs. As you walk the interpretive trail you will find a series of seven signs which discuss the geology, archaeology, cultural history, and biology of the flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To claim this Earthcache you need to post a photo(s) of your favorite view(s) along the trail and email me the answers to the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="margin-left:2em;"&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the stairway up onto the flow how thick (to nearest foot) is the flow? Assume each step is 7” high.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Title of sign at N 43° 42.288’ W 121° 14.135’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Title of sign at N 43° 42.197’ W 121° 14.146’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using your GPS what is the distance and heading (from True North) from the highest viewpoint (at the A Special Place on the Planet sign) to the edge of the flow (at the A Glass Menagerie sign).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While doing this earthcache you may also be able to collect the necessary information to claim several waymarks in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.earthcache.org" title="Earthcache Portal"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.geosociety.org/earthcache/pageGraphics/earthcache_32.gif" border="0" alt /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://imgcdn.geocaching.com/cache/f0a8dfc0-1cfd-416f-abe1-823e78ae4963.jpg?rnd=0.6323756" alt="Big Obsidian Flow" width="225" height="123" border="0" align="right" /&gt;The Big Obsidian Flow is the most recent eruption from Newberry Volcano. About 480 A.D. (1,470 calendar years B.P.), a 3-part sequence of rhyolitic eruptions began, which included an air-fall tephra, ash-flow tephra, and an obsidian flow, from a common vent at the base of the south caldera wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial Plinian eruption 480 A.D. (1,580 C14 yrs B.P.) produced the Newberry pumice fall deposit which blanketed the east flank of the volcano and areas to the east. About 200 yrs later the Paulina Lake ash flow (1,310 C14 yrs B.P.) spread from near the south caldera wall to Paulina Lake. The final phase of the eruption produced the Big Obsidian Flow which covers 2.8 sq km.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Carbon-14 age-dates must be corrected to give calendar or actual year age-dates. Primarily because the production of C-14 in the atmosphere by cosmic rays is not uniform through time, age-dates derived from C-14 must be calibrated with known dates. Conversion from C-14 to calendar years is now possible throughout the range of 0 to 11,390 calendar years ago based on tree ring chronologies and other methods allow corrections back to almost 22,000 calendar years. C-14 age-dates are always referenced to the year 1950 A.D. Calendar year age-dates are likewise referenced to 1950.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obsidian and pumice of this rhyolite lava flow contains about 73% silica (silicon dioxide) in comparison to the lava flows at Lava River Cave which only contain about 49% silica. The entire surface of this flow is glass (a liquid that cooled without crystallizing), the differences you see on the surface are due to the number and size of bubbles in the glass.&lt;/p&gt;

Great trail and information. Your earthcache helped with answering questions. A brand new ranger joined us for the hike and had slightly different answers :-) Sent my answers by email. Posting one photo of our group going up the stairs. I may post another of the wildflowers that are growing by themselves among a sea of rock. Life endures in almost any environment.

#3 of the Day in Oregon

Today we Visited the Newberry NVM and the crater lake NP from our Hotel base in Bend.

In Perfect Sunny and warm weather this was such a Great day and not really Knowing what to Expect from the Parks we were so delighted of the Things they offered to see!

WOW!!! This obsidian Flow is One of the Most remarkable Things we Ever saw. Never Knew that this existed.. So interesting - thanks so much for showing.
Favorite for the EC!

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I was out solo today as Sparky felt it was more important to get her nails done and go check on her horses.  We had to pass this one up several weeks earlier as by the time we had finished fishing, it was pretty darned hot so we passed on the mile walk.  I had run up here to grab a first to find or two and I wanted to make sure that I got this one logged this time.  It was in the low seventies when I started it.  The views are amazing.  I took several pictures and when I made it to the end, I was doing some of the homework required for the cache when a muggle asked if I was taking some kind of readings.  I barely got my ever sarcastic tongue stopped in time and told him I was working on an Earthcache.  He got excited and said "Oh! Is there one of those up here?" and began looking around.  I explained that an earthcache only required gathering information.  He quickly went back to his photo taking.  I finished my homework and took the photos I wanted and headed out.  Thanks for another extraordinary Earthcache, Volcanoguy and thanks for the special Smiley!!

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache was placed to replace a cache named "J Bone" by Bad Dogs but then archived in October of 2011.  There is a bench that has been erected in memory of a gent from Salem named Jim Bone who voulunteered for the Forest Service on trail work in the area.  It's a great site, with a great view, on the trail from the campgorund to the hot springs. You are looking for an ammo can with all the usual stuff in it.</groundspeak:long_description>

Was a great day for caching and there was only a "skiff" of snow anywhere to be seen.  Managed to find 38 today with 2 DNF's and started on the east side and worked west and north.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We were camped in Newberry Crater for a few days, trying to relax and do a little caching in the area.  Having just finished up Sea Flyer's X series, we embarked on these TL caches.  We were grateful for the hints since our GPSrs were often 40 - 60 feet off the posted coords when we finally located the cache.

Be forewarned -- your vehicle will get scratched on the TL series.  Kestrel Ridge's rig had superficial scratches; our truck, being full-sized, was not so lucky.  You will reach a point where there is no place to turn around or turn back.

That being said, we found all but one of the TL caches.  Glad to be done!</groundspeak:text>

A small pickup or OHV would make the trip easily. 

There was a tower here in the 1930's but abandoned.  Could not find any sign of a tower during a search of the area.  There is a view to the east and SE toward East Butte.  Elevation is 6575 ft.</groundspeak:long_description>

In my old Europe :) GC are found very often and it is a kind of race to be FTF ;-D
Even in deep forests or difficult to reach places...

Cache is in excellent shape and since the snow gate at 10-Mile is closed for the season I dont' expect that there will be any more visitors up here this year.  I didn't quite get the same elevation reading but that doesn't surprise me since my GPS'r wasn't calibrated very well.   TFTH, the hike up was a workout but it was a great bike ride back down the hill ... all the way to 10-Mile!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">For the "Road less traveled" cacher. This is an area I found deer
hunting in 1981. The area blessed me with a huge 4 point buck that
year but the part that I really remember is the view and solitude.
You look over Flat Top Butte and at the north-west side of Fort
Rock. I returned today while out hunting, no deer, but the solitude
and view remains. This cache is a long way out and for that reason
I am providing driving directions. Take Finley Butte road
(FS22)from La Pine, OR. about 19 miles east to FS24, travel south
approximately 4 miles to FS2233 turn left and proceed approximately
3/4 of a mile to FS550 (the sign is hard to find) it is the second
road on the right. Take the right fork about 1/4 of a mile up and
follow your GPS up the hill. You can park within 100 feet of the
cache if you are in something with a little ground clearance. I
drove our pickup all the way up in 2wd. You are looking for a camo
(black and gray) plastic peanut butter jar. Please put the blue lid
down to hide it a little. Best attempted on a nice NO SNOW day. Log
book, pen and three swag items. Enjoy the view!! (Alternate
route-Hwy 31 to FS24 to FS2233 then same as above)</groundspeak:long_description>

This rimrock is a thick outcrop of welded eruptive deposits from the eruption which formed Newberry Caldera about 75,000 years ago. There are a series of similar outcrops extending for three quarters of miles to the north. From the top of this outcrop there is wonderful view of Newberry Caldera. Features visible from here include (from south to north) East Lake Obsidian Flows, Big Obsidian Flow, Paulina Peak, Little Crater, Central Pumice Cone, Interlake Obsidian Flow, East Lake Fissure, and Sheep’s Rump.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;font:10.0px Geneva;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing:0.0px;"&gt;I placed a small camouflaged peanut butter jar in the rimrock.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I wonder how a lot of GC are so rarely found around here !!!

In my old Europe :) GC are found very often and it is a kind of race to be FTF ;-D
Even in deep forests or difficult to reach places...

Anyway, thanks again to all owners In the State where it all belonged !</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Had planned on hiking for some caches around Horse Ridge today, but after all the new caches came up around Paulina Lake, we changed our plans and went for the FTF's. Started our first hike from the TH on the east side of the lake. Ended up hiking 9.36 miles in 5 1/2 hours with 1 1/2 hours of stop time. Saw lots of great views and a few fisherman on the water. After that hike, we drove over near this cache to hike for the last two new ones and picked this one up on the way. Great job on the cammo, but walked right to it. Made it a favorite. TFTH.

Got stopped by trees down across the road a couple of times, but no snow anywhere.  Had three dnf's, a few had wet logs, but all in all in pretty good shape.  Thanks for the fun we had today.

Was a great day for caching and there was only a "skiff" of snow anywhere to be seen.  Managed to find 38 today with 2 DNF's and started on the east side and worked west and north. Will try to get back later this week to work on the two loops I didn't get to today. Knew I wouldn't get them all done today, so left about half for next trip. TFTH. SL</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We were camped in Newberry Crater for a few days, trying to relax and do a little caching in the area.  Having just finished up Sea Flyer's X series, we embarked on these TL caches.  We were grateful for the hints since our GPSrs were often 40 - 60 feet off the posted coords when we finally located the cache.

Be forewarned -- your vehicle will get scratched on the TL series.  Kestrel Ridge's rig had superficial scratches; our truck, being full-sized, was not so lucky.  You will reach a point where there is no place to turn around or turn back.

That being said, we found all but one of the TL caches.  Glad to be done!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;For the last eight years I’ve been volunteering with the U.S. Geological Survey during the summer as a field assistant to help with the geologic mapping of Newberry Volcano. Today, I was working the east rim of Newberry caldera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is located on a spatter rim overlooking a large crater in the middle of the north segment of the East Rim Fissure which erupted about 11,000 years ago. There is a great view of the caldera from here, including the dome in SE corner of the caldera, Paulina Peak, Diamond Peak (Cascades), Little Crater, East Lake, Central Pumice Cone, Paulina Lake, Interlake Flow, East Lake Fissure, and Sheep’s Rump.&lt;/p&gt;

AND, if you drive ATVs like we do, this is a little play area for those.  If you don't, might want to think about going back out the way you came in.

I enjoyed seeing all of the obsidian and pumice along the road.  When we arrived at the end of the road, I let them rest and I scampered up the hill to the cache.  I found the cache safe and sound.  I rescued a travel bug, enjoyed the view and then made my way back to the family and then back to the car.  Enjoyed the hike and wish I could have completed all three</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This mystery cache is located on the Paulina Peak rhyolite flow but not at the listed coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This mystery cache in not at the listed coordinates. To find this mystery cache you must first finish the Paulina Peak Flow cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last nine years I’ve been volunteering with the U.S. Geological Survey during the summer as a field assistant to help with the geologic mapping of Newberry Volcano. Recently I was working the western end of the Paulina Peak rhyolite flow to collect samples for chemical analysis    . &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulina Peak is the high point on the rim of Newberry Caldera and is part of a large rhyolite flow which  extends two and a half miles to the west-southwest.  The flow was erupted about 80,000 years ago, a few thousand years before the large eruption which formed Newberry Caldera. The source of the flow collapsed into the caldera leaving Paulina Peak as the high point on the rim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find this cache involves about a three mile loop across the western end of the rhyolite flow. You will need to collect information at two of the four waypoints along the route to the Paulina Peak Flow Cache (GC57GGD). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are small metal tags with three letters at each waypoint. The four waypoints are located along an old overgrown logging road which probably dates from the 1960s. The old road offers a general path to follow but portions are heavily overgrown and it maybe easier to leave the road at times. From the last waypoint to the cache is cross country. From the cache site finding Bonus #1 and Bonus #2 will lead you back to within about a quarter of a mile of the starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a small 2” x 3” green box with log and a few small trade items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulina Peak Flow Bonus #1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N 43° 40.xxx’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;W 121° 17.yyy’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xxx = sum of the three letters on the tag at WP1 with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A = 299&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B = 267&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C = 211&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D = 251&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yyy = sum of the three letters on the tag at WP3 with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A = 172&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B = 155&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C = 123&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D = 194&lt;/p&gt;

I wonder how a lot of GC are so rarely found around here !!!

In my old Europe :) GC are found very often and it is a kind of race to be FTF ;-D
Even in deep forests or difficult to reach places...

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Headed out early this morning to work on your series of caches south of Paulina and East Lake before they get snowed in. Was a great day for caching and there was only a "skiff" of snow anywhere to be seen.  Managed to find 38 today with 2 DNF's and started on the east side and worked west and north. Will try to get back later this week to work on the two loops I didn't get to today. Knew I wouldn't get them all done today, so left about half for next trip. TFTH. SL</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We were camped in Newberry Crater for a few days, trying to relax and do a little caching in the area.  Having just finished up Sea Flyer's X series, we embarked on these TL caches.  We were grateful for the hints since our GPSrs were often 40 - 60 feet off the posted coords when we finally located the cache.

Be forewarned -- your vehicle will get scratched on the TL series.  Kestrel Ridge's rig had superficial scratches; our truck, being full-sized, was not so lucky.  You will reach a point where there is no place to turn around or turn back.

That being said, we found all but one of the TL caches.  Glad to be done!</groundspeak:text>

This rimrock capped ridge is interpreted to be a remnant of the rim for an older caldera.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">parked maybe a half a mile south of cinder butte and took off thru the blowdown.  had about .9 miles to go to the cache and the first half was thru an open lodgepole stand with blowdown.  the blowdown wasn't too bad being only about knee high.  

the second half gets steeper but you also get into mountain hemlock and it clears out underneath so walking isn't too bad.  a lot easier coming down though.

last cache of the day as i was tired and hot after hiking steep ground at some altitude and the day was heating up.

only elkjim has been to this cache so the cacher from germany has a bogus claim on finding this cache.  checked his profile and he did caches in germany on the same day so no way could he have been here to do this cache.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">After battering our truck on Sea Flyer's X and TL trails yesterday, we opted to give it a rest and hike around Paulina Lake, picking up caches that have been placed since our last hike here.  We appreciated the hints since our coords didn't always match the posted ones.  About halfway around the lake we got a surprise downpour (no rain in the forecast) complete with thunder and lightning.  It made for a soggy but refreshing hike.  Thanks for all the caches around the lake!

Like others before us, we had a difficult time interpreting the hints and spent way too much time here.  Go between the logs in our photo, and look left about halfway between the little trees for this cache.  It was too well-hidden when we found it.  Now, the pill bottle can be seen from 2 directions, if you're a geocacher!</groundspeak:text>

Was a great day for caching and there was only a "skiff" of snow anywhere to be seen.  Managed to find 38 today with 2 DNF's and started on the east side and worked west and north. Will try to get back later this week to work on the two loops I didn't get to today. Knew I wouldn't get them all done today, so left about half for next trip. TFTH. SL</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We were camped in Newberry Crater for a few days, trying to relax and do a little caching in the area.  Having just finished up Sea Flyer's X series, we embarked on these TL caches.  We were grateful for the hints since our GPSrs were often 40 - 60 feet off the posted coords when we finally located the cache.

Be forewarned -- your vehicle will get scratched on the TL series.  Kestrel Ridge's rig had superficial scratches; our truck, being full-sized, was not so lucky.  You will reach a point where there is no place to turn around or turn back.

That being said, we found all but one of the TL caches.  Glad to be done!</groundspeak:text>

Started our hike from the TH on the east side of the lake. Ended up hiking 9.36 miles in 5 1/2 hours with 1 1/2 hours of stop time. Saw lots of great views and a few fisherman on the water. Made the short but steep hike up the hill to make the find. TFTH. SL</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This mystery cache is located on the Paulina Peak rhyolite flow but not at the listed coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This mystery cache in not at the listed coordinates. To find this mystery cache you must first finish the Paulina Peak Flow cache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last nine years I&amp;rsquo;ve been volunteering with the U.S. Geological Survey during the summer as a field assistant to help with the geologic mapping of Newberry Volcano. Recently I was working the western end of the Paulina Peak rhyolite flow to collect samples for chemical analysis&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paulina Peak is the high point on the rim of Newberry Caldera and is part of a large rhyolite flow which&amp;nbsp; extends two and a half miles to the west-southwest.&amp;nbsp; The flow was erupted about 80,000 years ago, a few thousand years before the large eruption which formed Newberry Caldera. The source of the flow collapsed into the caldera leaving Paulina Peak as the high point on the rim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find this cache involves about a three mile loop across the western end of the rhyolite flow. You will need to collect information at two of the four waypoints along the route to the Paulina Peak Flow Cache (GC57GGD).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are small metal tags with three letters at each waypoint. The four waypoints are located along an old overgrown logging road which probably dates from the 1960s. The old road offers a general path to follow but portions are heavily overgrown and it maybe easier to leave the road at times. From the last waypoint to the cache is cross country. From the cache site finding Bonus #1 and Bonus #2 will lead you back to within about a quarter of a mile of the starting point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cache is a small 2&amp;rdquo; x 3&amp;rdquo; red box with log and a few small trade items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paulina Peak Flow Bonus #2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;N 43&amp;deg; 40.xxx&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;W 121&amp;deg; 17.yyy&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;xxx = sum of the three letters on the tag at WP2 with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A = 299&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B = 233&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C = 211&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D = 263&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;yyy = sum of the three letters on the tag at WP4 with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A = 279&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B = 223&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C = 235&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D = 294&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">After battering our truck on Sea Flyer's X and TL trails yesterday, we opted to give it a rest and hike around Paulina Lake, picking up caches that have been placed since our last hike here.  We appreciated the hints since our coords didn't always match the posted ones.  About halfway around the lake we got a surprise downpour (no rain in the forecast) complete with thunder and lightning.  It made for a soggy but refreshing hike.  Thanks for all the caches around the lake!</groundspeak:text>

I wonder how a lot of GC are so rarely found around here !!!

In my old Europe :) GC are found very often and it is a kind of race to be FTF ;-D
Even in deep forests or difficult to reach places...

Started our hike from the TH on the east side of the lake. Ended up hiking 9.36 miles in 5 1/2 hours with 1 1/2 hours of stop time. Saw lots of great views and a few fisherman on the water. Enjoyed the hike up to the cache and the cache container. Made it a favorite. Trickier getting down than going up. TFTH. SL</groundspeak:text>

I was hiking and caching with my friends the SKAndersons  when I decided to put my poles down and try to get the GPS settled in when my friend, who was up above me, chuckled and I had an "Oy-duh" moment.

"up a lonely road" is most likely gone as the small pile of logs is now just splinters after what appears to be a bear has torn it to shreds. said bear most likely hauled off the cache as well thinking it had something to treasure. some wet logs but most were ok.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This multi-cache is located on the Paulina Peak rhyolite flow.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;For the last nine years I’ve been volunteering with the U.S. Geological Survey during the summer as a field assistant to help with the geologic mapping of Newberry Volcano. Recently I was working the western end of the Paulina Peak rhyolite flow to collect samples for chemical analysis    . &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulina Peak is the high point on the rim of Newberry Caldera and is part of a large rhyolite flow which  extends two and a half miles to the west-southwest.  The flow was erupted about 80,000 years ago, a few thousand years before the large eruption which formed Newberry Caldera. The source of the flow collapsed into the caldera leaving Paulina Peak as the high point on the rim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This multi-cache involves about a three mile loop across the western end of the rhyolite flow. You will need to find four waypoints along the way to find the cache location. There are small metal tags with three letters at each waypoint. The tags at the waypoints will also provide the clues need to find two bonus caches along the return route to the starting point.  The four waypoints are located along an old overgrown logging road which probably dates from the 1960s. The old road offers a general path to follow but portions are heavily overgrown and it maybe easier to leave the road at times. From the last waypoint to the cache is cross country. From the cache site finding Bonus #1 and Bonus #2 will lead you back to within about a quarter of a mile of the starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a duct tape covered plastic jar with log and trade items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waypoint 1 - starting point on F.S. Rd. 2121-100 at an elevation of about 5840 feet.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N 43° 40.868’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;W 121° 18.112’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Road was rough and loose from cat work when I placed this cache. If your vehicle does not have good clearance try parking at the junction of Rd. 2121 and Rd. 2121-110 and then hiking cross country to the starting point which will add about a half mile to the total round trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waypoint 2 - at about 6140 feet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N 43° 40.xxx’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;W 121° 18.yyy’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xxx = sum of the three letters on the tag at WP1 with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A = 199&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B = 139&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;
The original description follows:  During deer hunting season 2006, Dad told our group about a GPS game he'd been introduced to while on a trail ride a month or so earlier. That tale of 'hide and seek with GPSRs' sparked two new geocaching teams, Lost-A-Pair and ours. In the last year we've had a blast hunting and hiding these things. The events we've attended have been great. I thought it would be fitting to plant this cache while out hunting with Dad a year later.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">planned on doing the "al" loop going clockwise but that didn't work out as the road is blocked by down trees just after "al1". so i headed out and started at "al10" working counterclockwise. no problems with the rest of the loop road. spent the most time at "al4" but finally found it. "up a lonely road" is most likely gone as the small pile of logs is now just splinters after what appears to be a bear has torn it to shreds. said bear most likely hauled off the cache as well thinking it had something to treasure. some wet logs but most were ok.</groundspeak:text>

Having just finished up Sea Flyer's X series, we embarked on these TL caches.  We were grateful for the hints since our GPSrs were often 40 - 60 feet off the posted coords when we finally located the cache.

Be forewarned -- your vehicle will get scratched on the TL series.  Kestrel Ridge's rig had superficial scratches; our truck, being full-sized, was not so lucky.  You will reach a point where there is no place to turn around or turn back.

That being said, we found all but one of the TL caches.  Glad to be done!</groundspeak:text>

After orienting yourself and and visiting the Visitor Center (if open), drive east to the Big Obsidian Flow and hike to the highest viewpoint. This is one of the better and most easily reached viewpoints on the floor of Newberry Crater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the following information:&lt;br /&gt;
A - N 43° 44.500 W 121° 14.135&lt;br /&gt;
B - N 43° 40.900 W 121° 14.205&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;#1 - Coordinates at the highest viewpoint on the Big Obsidian Flow trail.&lt;br /&gt;
#2 - Use your GPS to determine the distance to Pt. A.&lt;br /&gt;
#3 - Use your GPS to determine the distance to Pt. B.&lt;br /&gt;
#4 - Use your GPS to determine the distance to Pt. C.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The recognized geographic name for the feature at the summit of Newberry Volcano is Newberry Crater.&lt;br /&gt;
Although the first use of caldera in geologic literature was in 1815, the term’s definition has evolved over time and the modern definition of a caldera dates to 1979 when Williams and McBirney redefined calderas as “large collapse depressions, more or less circular in form, the diameter of which is many times greater than any included vent.” A more general description of a caldera is that it is a large collapse feature and can be many miles in diameter while a crater is generally a constructional feature that is typically less than a mile in diameter.&lt;br /&gt;
Answer #2 plus #3 is the minimum diameter of Newberry Crater.&lt;br /&gt;
Answer #4 is the diameter of the largest exposed vent in Newberry Crater.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;#5 - What do you think the summit feature of Newberry Volcano should be called?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caldera collapse is associated with large-scale magma eruption. The eruption can be non-explosive and feed large volume lava flows or it can be explosive and erupt large volumes of pumice and ash. The caldera forming eruption often begins from a single vent and expands to a ring vent phase during which the caldera collapse occurs. Following caldera formation future eruptions can be scattered across the caldera or localized along structural trends. In smaller calderas later eruptions can fill the caldera and build a new summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following description of Newberry Volcano and Newberry Caldera is based on ongoing research by the U.S. Geological Survey and is summarized in USGS Fact Sheet 2011-3145 “Newberry Volcano—Central Oregon’s Sleeping Giant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growth of Newberry Volcano began about 400,000 years ago. Before formation of the caldera, Newberry’s summit was 500 to as much as 1,000 feet higher than present-day 7,984-foot Paulina Peak &lt;b&gt;(Paulina Peak Earthcache - GCQ0Z1)&lt;/b&gt;. Newberry caldera was created about 75,000 years ago by a major explosive eruption and collapse event. This was the most recent of at least three caldera-forming eruptions that erupted pumice (frothy volcanic glass) high into the air and spread flows of extremely hot gases, ash, and pumice, called “pyroclastic flows,” across the volcano’s surface. Later lava flows have partly buried the deposits from this eruption, but one exposure can be seen at Paulina Creek Falls &lt;b&gt;(Paulina Creek Falls Earthcache - GCQ36T)&lt;/b&gt;, where a deposit of pyroclastic flow and fall material was so hot that ash and pumice particles were welded together and then cooled into solidified rock (“tuff of Paulina Creek Falls”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the most recent caldera-forming eruption, vents on the north side of Newberry fed large lava flows westward, which created and then flowed through Lava River Cave &lt;b&gt;(Lava River Cave Earthcache - GCQ5FJ)&lt;/b&gt; , diverting the Deschutes River. The lava flow that underlies downtown Bend and the Redmond airport is from that same eruption. Once the caldera was formed, more eruptions began to fill it with lava flows, and lava also erupted at numerous sites outside the caldera, covering much of the volcano’s north and south flanks. Between the end of the last Ice Age (about 12,000 years ago) and 7,700 years ago, Newberry Volcano erupted at least a dozen times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 7,700 years ago, a massive eruption caused the collapse of ancient “Mount Mazama,” forming a caldera that holds present-day Crater Lake, Oregon. Winds blew volcanic ash from that eruption northeast over Newberry Volcano, which is 75 miles away, covering much of it in a blanket of dusty ash and pumice as much as 6 feet thick on the volcano’s south flank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first eruptions after deposition of the Mazama ash came from a fissure that opened through the middle of Newberry caldera. The eruption formed a ridge that divides East Lake from Paulina Lake. Along the fissure are the Interlake Obsidian Flow and Central Pumice Cone. The cone rises 700 feet above East Lake. It was built explosively when hot molten rock (magma) cooled and shattered after entering the lake water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 7,000 years ago, a 20-mile-long fissure system extending northwest from the caldera opened up, forming the Northwest Rift Zone from which fluid lavas erupted from numerous cinder and spatter cones. Numerous vents erupted, including 500-foot-high Lava Butte &lt;b&gt;(Lava Butte Summit Earthcache - GCQ9GZ)&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;(Lava Butte Breach Earthcache - GCQ7YG)&lt;/b&gt;, which spawned a lava flow that temporarily dammed the Deschutes River at Benham Falls &lt;b&gt;(Benham Falls Earthcache - GCQ5FP)&lt;/b&gt; . In places, fluid lavas surrounded and burned trees, leaving behind hollow molds, like those found along the trail at Lava Cast Forest &lt;b&gt;(Lava Cast Forest Earthcache - GCPW9X)&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most recent eruption at Newberry, about 1,300 years ago, took place within the caldera. Explosive plumes of volcanic ash and pyroclastic flows were followed by slower lava flows of obsidian (volcanic glass) that created the spectacular Big Obsidian Flow &lt;b&gt;(Big Obsidian Flow Earthcache - GCQ36N)&lt;/b&gt;. Not only did more than 10 feet of ash and fragments of volcanic rock fall inside the eastern caldera, but the ash can be found as far to the east as Idaho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both caldera lakes, Paulina Lake and East Lake, have hot springs with temperatures as high as 135° Fahrenheit. In 1981, temperatures higher than 500° Fahrenheit at a depth of 3,000 feet were found in a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) drill hole sited in the center of the caldera. These temperature measurements indicate that an active magma system lies beneath Newberry Volcano.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;For the last nine years I&amp;rsquo;ve been volunteering with the U.S. Geological Survey during the summer as a field assistant to help with the geologic mapping of Newberry Volcano. Today, I made a long off trail loop hike between Paulina and East Lakes. This location was the high point of the hike and provides a good view of East Lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warm Springs Cone is our unofficial name for the buried cinder cone at the base of the north caldera wall between Paulina and East Lake. The cone is buried by tephra from the eruption of the Interlake Obsidian Flow 7500 years ago which occurred just east of it. The cone is believed to be the source of the lava flow which forms the east shore of Paulina Lake from the Interlake Flow to Little Crater Campground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The starting point to reach the summit of Warm Springs Cone is from the trailhead at the north end of Little Crater Campground. The route is your choice, some are better than others.&amp;nbsp; The cache is small green plastic container with room for a few small trade items.&lt;/p&gt;

some blow down to deal with and a little brush to wind thru but just kind of plodded along.  came down the west side which is all mountain hemlock, very steep but with nothing on the ground to impede progress.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;For the last eight years I’ve been volunteering with the U.S. Geological Survey during the summer as a field assistant to help with the geologic mapping of Newberry Volcano. Today, I was working the north rim of Newberry caldera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is located at the top of the East Lake Fissure on the edge of the northern most crater along this segment of NW Rift Zone. This segment of the NW Rift Zone is about third of a mile and drops from the rim (~7400 feet) to lake level (~6380 feet) or lower. The NW Rift Zone  extends northward for about 15 miles and eruptions occurred over a couple of hundred years about 7000 years ago with eruptions along different segments at different times.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">well today was the day to finish up some caches on the rim. my bike was ready but was i? dropped a rig at paulina day use area and then headed up to the trail at the junction of 21 and 2127. i am so glad that i didn't attempt to do this in a clockwise manner as the trail coming out of paulina is steep, steep, steep.

the trail overall was pretty enjoyable. pedaled some, coasted some and pushed some. especially the "big push" was a "big push". weather was good with clear skies and when i left at 0730 hrs the temp was 40 degrees.

found all the caches i was looking for and all were in good shape except a couple were damp. was glad to get done and off the home stretch where the trail was soooo steep that several times i had both brakes locked up and sliding. i walked several of the severe downhill sections and also where there were trees across the trail and some huge waterbars. all in all a fun ride with no people or critters spotted. got back to the day use area at 1200hrs.

glad i didn't have to go any further downhill.</groundspeak:text>

Was a great day for caching and there was only a "skiff" of snow anywhere to be seen.  Managed to find 38 today with 2 DNF's and started on the east side and worked west and north. Will try to get back later this week to work on the two loops I didn't get to today. Knew I wouldn't get them all done today, so left about half for next trip. TFTH. SL</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">The starting coordinates will put you in the parking area for Paulina Creek Falls, which is a Recreation Fee Site requiring a parking pass. The area is usually accessable from early-June to mid-November.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is the fourth in a series of eight Earthcaches being developed at major points of interest in Newberry National Volcanic Monument in cooperation with the staff of the Deschutes National Forest. This EarthCache is located along two trails which begin from the parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To claim this Earthcache you need to post a photo(s) of your favorite view(s) and email me the answers to the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is written near N 43° 42.728’ W 121° 16.958’?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using your GPS what is the distance and heading (from True North) from the upper viewpoint to the viewpoint across the creek (N 43° 42.761’ W 121° 16.984’). This will give you the width of the canyon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using your GPS what is the distance and heading (from True North) from the lower viewpoint to the viewpoint across the creek (N 43° 42.761’ W 121° 16.984’).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While doing this earthcache you may also be able to collect the necessary information to claim several waymarks in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to visit the viewpoint on the other side of the creek, park at the Paulina Lake Day Use site. Walk to the lake’s outlet, cross Paulina Creek at the dam/road, and take the Peter Skene Ogden Trail west for about a third of a mile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://imgcdn.geocaching.com/cache/7f7a6637-d6cd-4058-b869-a6a8907d09d3.jpg?rnd=0.09221393" alt="Paulina Creek Falls" width="250" height="128" align="right" /&gt; Paulina Creek drains Paulina Lake, less than half a mile to the east. Paulina Creek Falls is a double falls that drops about 60 feet onto the jumble of rocks below. The rocks that form the cliffs of the falls are agglutinated andesitic pyroclastic deposits formed of many thin to thick units during the caldera forming eruption about 75,000 years ago. Below the cliffs are poorly sorted and bedded ash, lapilli, and blocks. The contact between the lower and upper unit is gradational and most likely represents a change in eruption style from relatively cold material to hot material that welded together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jumble of rocks at the base of the falls is the result of the falls slowly eroding their way upstream. Near the end of May 1983 a large section of the cliff between the falls fell to the base of the falls due to erosion of the weaker deposits at the base of the cliff and freeze-thaw action behind the cliff face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you walk out to the upper viewpoint notice how much wider the canyon is downstream from the trail than it is at the viewpoint. The narrower canyon at the viewpoint is the result of a large flood sometime between 5000 and 2000 years ago. Before the flood there was plenty of time for freeze thaw action to attack the canyon walls and widen them as the falls moved slowly upstream. At the time of the flood the volume of flow was 220 to 550 times more than the current average stream flow rate (18 cubic feet per second). Studies of flood deposits and erosional features along Paulina Creek indicate that the estimated flow rate was in the range of 4,000 to 10,000 cubic feet per second. This large flood rapidly (a day or two) cut a narrow channel upstream a couple hundred feet. The most likely cause for the flood was the collapse of a small 5 to 8 foot high waterfall at the lake's outlet suddenly lowering the lake that amount. Image what will happen when Paulina Creek Falls reaches the lake at some time in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

I shuttled drivers back to the sno park at the beginning of the day's adventure and came here since it was more than halfway from our campground.  Great site and the sun was just right coming down into the falls area.  On the way out I met a few people who wanted some information on the falls and site that I was able to answer from the experience with this earthcache.  Email sent with answers.

"up a lonely road" is most likely gone as the small pile of logs is now just splinters after what appears to be a bear has torn it to shreds. said bear most likely hauled off the cache as well thinking it had something to treasure. some wet logs but most were ok.</groundspeak:text>

"x4" was the hardest to find of the series for me. "x6" was laying on the ground so i put it back where it needed to be. "x12" is covered with biting red ants so watch out.

nobody around which is always pleasant. no critters. roads are soft and washboardy. weather was getting hotter than i enjoy.</groundspeak:text>

The temperature was in the teens when I left Redmond and remained very cold throughout the day. However, the sun was shining and there wasn't any wind so the cold was bearable. Made the loop of the AL series of caches, picked up a couple of others as well and then did the loop of the X series with a couple of back tracks. Last one for the day. Thanks for putting out all of these caches while you were in the area. TFTH. SL</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Had planned on hiking for some caches around Horse Ridge today, but after all the new caches came up around Paulina Lake, we changed our plans and went for the FTF's. Started our hike from the TH on the east side of the lake. Ended up hiking 9.36 miles in 5 1/2 hours with 1 1/2 hours of stop time. Saw lots of great views and a few fisherman on the water. Read the sign at the TH regarding a spur trail to the hot springs so took it off the main loop trail to the east of the cache. Got us down to the water about .1 east and followed the shoreline over to make the find. The hike back up to the main trail was the cardio for the day. Made the a favorite for the location. TFTH.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">well today was the day to finish up some caches on the rim. my bike was ready but was i? dropped a rig at paulina day use area and then headed up to the trail at the junction of 21 and 2127. i am so glad that i didn't attempt to do this in a clockwise manner as the trail coming out of paulina is steep, steep, steep.

the trail overall was pretty enjoyable. pedaled some, coasted some and pushed some. especially the "big push" was a "big push". weather was good with clear skies and when i left at 0730 hrs the temp was 40 degrees.

found all the caches i was looking for and all were in good shape except a couple were damp. was glad to get done and off the home stretch where the trail was soooo steep that several times i had both brakes locked up and sliding. i walked several of the severe downhill sections and also where there were trees across the trail and some huge waterbars. all in all a fun ride with no people or critters spotted. got back to the day use area at 1200hrs.

this cache is also being used as one of the caches for shotgun's cache maintenance challenge. found cache was in serviceable condition as was any waypoint if applicable.

"up a lonely road" is most likely gone as the small pile of logs is now just splinters after what appears to be a bear has torn it to shreds.  said bear most likely hauled off the cache as well thinking it had something to treasure.  some wet logs but most were ok.</groundspeak:text>

TFTC ! From a french geocacheur visiting Oregon for the very first time :)

I wonder how a lot of GC are so rarely found around here !!!

In my old Europe :) GC are found very often and it is a kind of race to be FTF ;-D
Even in deep forests or difficult to reach places...

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;While preparing for a day of caching on the east side of Newberry I noted that there was an area about 7 miles across with no caches.  I’ve been to this location multiple times while volunteering with the USGS so decided to place a cache here near the center of the cache less area. The geologic mapping has identified several hundred vents and associated flows but there are very few named features on Newberry so we use informal names for many features.  We call this cinder cone Washed Butte and it was burnt over during the 1988 Paulina Fire resulting in a great 360° view which includes the east flank of Newberry Volcano, the top of Mt. Jefferson, Mt. Hood, Pine Mountain, East Butte and China Hat. Container is a small 2” X 3” plastic container.&lt;/p&gt;

About halfway around the lake we got a surprise downpour (no rain in the forecast) complete with thunder and lightning.  It made for a soggy but refreshing hike.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;One day we were working caches in the Fort Rock area, and were headed back to Bend the "back way".  Upon seeing this unique formation, we knew it needed a cache.  Like the phoenix rising from the ashes,  this pine has held its ground and thrived amid its unique cradle.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Update 4/26/15 - Placed new container, just like the old container - a straightforward geocache log. Please replace it exactly as you found it. Thx.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should be a quick park-and-grab.   You're looking for a small bison tube.  Holds nothing but the log, so please bring your own geo-scribbling implement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geocaching, like any other outdoor activity, carries with it a certain degree of risk for which you accept responsibility.  Always use common sense, put your own safety and that of your party first, and respect the ground that you are on.   Your decision to search for this cache constitutes your agreement to hold the 'placers' of said cache harmless for any damages or injuries sustained, incidental or consequential, arising from your activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;For the last eight years I’ve been volunteering with the U.S. Geological Survey during the summer as a field assistant to help with the geologic mapping of Newberry Volcano. Today, I was working the north rim of Newberry caldera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is located on the rim of the southern most set craters of the North Summit segment of the NW Rift Zone.  The cache (small red box) is less than a fifth of a mile off the Rim trail. This segment extends NNW for 1.5 miles and the NW Rift Zone has a total length of 15 miles. The NW Rift Zone eruptions occurred over a couple of hundred years about 7000 years ago with eruptions along different segments at different times.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">well today was the day to finish up some caches on the rim. my bike was ready but was i? dropped a rig at paulina day use area and then headed up to the trail at the junction of 21 and 2127. i am so glad that i didn't attempt to do this in a clockwise manner as the trail coming out of paulina is steep, steep, steep.

the trail overall was pretty enjoyable. pedaled some, coasted some and pushed some. especially the "big push" was a "big push". weather was good with clear skies and when i left at 0730 hrs the temp was 40 degrees.

found all the caches i was looking for and all were in good shape except a couple were damp. was glad to get done and off the home stretch where the trail was soooo steep that several times i had both brakes locked up and sliding. i walked several of the severe downhill sections and also where there were trees across the trail and some huge waterbars. all in all a fun ride with no people or critters spotted. got back to the day use area at 1200hrs.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">well today was the day to finish up some caches on the rim. my bike was ready but was i? dropped a rig at paulina day use area and then headed up to the trail at the junction of 21 and 2127. i am so glad that i didn't attempt to do this in a clockwise manner as the trail coming out of paulina is steep, steep, steep.

the trail overall was pretty enjoyable. pedaled some, coasted some and pushed some. especially the "big push" was a "big push". weather was good with clear skies and when i left at 0730 hrs the temp was 40 degrees.

found all the caches i was looking for and all were in good shape except a couple were damp. was glad to get done and off the home stretch where the trail was soooo steep that several times i had both brakes locked up and sliding. i walked several of the severe downhill sections and also where there were trees across the trail and some huge waterbars. all in all a fun ride with no people or critters spotted. got back to the day use area at 1200hrs.

this cache is also being used as one of the caches for shotgun's cache maintenance challenge. found cache was in serviceable condition as was any waypoint if applicable.

for some reason this one took me awhile.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">headed west after doing the "al" loop to do the "x series". all were pretty easy finds and the logs were ok although a few were damp. did some roadside trimming of brush to get to "x2, x3, and x4". "x4" was the hardest to find of the series for me. "x6" was laying on the ground so i put it back where it needed to be. "x12" is covered with biting red ants so watch out.

nobody around which is always pleasant. no critters. roads are soft and washboardy. weather was getting hotter than i enjoy.</groundspeak:text>

Made the loop of the AL series of caches, picked up a couple of others as well and then did the loop of the X series with a couple of back tracks. 

Headed down the seldom used track in an attempt to get the next 4 caches in the X series. Picked this one and #3 without incident, but ran into a large tree across the road trying to get to #4 so turned around with the idea I would approach from the other side after picking up #5. As it turned out, there was another tree down on that road as well between # 5 and #4. Appears that some people had driven off road to get around that tree, but I decided to park and took the short hike to get #4. TFTC. SL</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;For the last eight years I’ve been volunteering with the U.S. Geological Survey during the summer as a field assistant to help with the geologic mapping of Newberry Volcano. Today, I was working the north rim of Newberry caldera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is located on the rim of a large post-caldera cinder cone which erupted high on the caldera wall. The cache (small light blue box) is about a tenth of mile off the Rim trail. The view from this location includes the North rim, East Lake, the Hot Springs Flows, the Interlake Flow, Central Pumice Cone, the SE rim dome, Little Crater, Big Obsidian Flow, South rim, Paulina Peak, Paulina Lake and the Lakeshore domes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;For the last eight years I’ve been volunteering with the U.S. Geological Survey during the summer as a field assistant to help with the geologic mapping of Newberry Volcano. Today, I was working the north rim of Newberry caldera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache (small green box) is located on the rim above the NW corner of Paulina Lake near the Rim Trail. The view from here includes the Red Slide vent, Interlake Flow, Central Pumice Cone, the SE rim dome, Little Crater, Big Obsidian Flow, the South rim, Paulina Peak, Paulina Lake and the Lakeshore domes.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">well today was the day to finish up some caches on the rim. my bike was ready but was i? dropped a rig at paulina day use area and then headed up to the trail at the junction of 21 and 2127. i am so glad that i didn't attempt to do this in a clockwise manner as the trail coming out of paulina is steep, steep, steep.

the trail overall was pretty enjoyable. pedaled some, coasted some and pushed some. especially the "big push" was a "big push". weather was good with clear skies and when i left at 0730 hrs the temp was 40 degrees.

found all the caches i was looking for and all were in good shape except a couple were damp. was glad to get done and off the home stretch where the trail was soooo steep that several times i had both brakes locked up and sliding. i walked several of the severe downhill sections and also where there were trees across the trail and some huge waterbars. all in all a fun ride with no people or critters spotted. got back to the day use area at 1200hrs.

cache is swarming with big black ants.</groundspeak:text>

this cache is also being used as one of the caches for shotgun's cache maintenance challenge. found cache was in serviceable condition as was any waypoint if applicable.

liked the circle and added another rock to the center.

nobody around which is always pleasant. no critters. roads are soft and washboardy. weather was getting hotter than i enjoy.</groundspeak:text>

The temperature was in the teens when I left Redmond and remained very cold throughout the day. However, the sun was shining and there wasn't any wind so the cold was bearable. Made the loop of the AL series of caches, picked up a couple of others as well and then did the loop of the X series with a couple of back tracks. 

Headed down the seldom used track in an attempt to get the next 4 caches in the X series. Picked this one up without incident, but ran into a large tree across the road trying to get to #4 so turned around with the idea I would approach from the other side after picking up #5. As it turned out, there was another tree down on that road as well between # 5 and #4. Appears that some people had driven off road to get around that tree, but I decided to park and took the short hike to get #4. TFTC. SL</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;This cache is located at the summit of the North Paulina Peak cinder cone. The cache (small dark blue box) is about a third of mile off the Rim trail. North Paulina Peak is one of a series of post-caldera cinder cones located along a caldera circumferential fault. Moving around the summit there are views of China Hat, the South rim of the caldera, Paulina Peak, Cascade peaks, Pilpil Butte, Lowullo Butte, and the North Summit Flow.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">well today was the day to finish up some caches on the rim. my bike was ready but was i? dropped a rig at paulina day use area and then headed up to the trail at the junction of 21 and 2127. i am so glad that i didn't attempt to do this in a clockwise manner as the trail coming out of paulina is steep, steep, steep.

the trail overall was pretty enjoyable. pedaled some, coasted some and pushed some. especially the "big push" was a "big push". weather was good with clear skies and when i left at 0730 hrs the temp was 40 degrees.

found all the caches i was looking for and all were in good shape except a couple were damp. was glad to get done and off the home stretch where the trail was soooo steep that several times i had both brakes locked up and sliding. i walked several of the severe downhill sections and also where there were trees across the trail and some huge waterbars. all in all a fun ride with no people or critters spotted. got back to the day use area at 1200hrs.

came over from the bike trail and huffed and puffed my way up the hill.  was amazed at the amount of obsidian chips laying around.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">A nice location in Oregon's High Desert.  Access by vehicle is possible.  The roads can get a little bumpy.  No hiking required but you'll have to crawl around on some rocks during your hunt!  Elevation is 4546, so you may encounter snow at certain times of year!</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The cache is a small ammo can full of goodies for all ages.  It's hidden well, but shouldn't be too hard to find.  Coordinates were accurate during placement (+/- 7ft).
If you plan a trip out here, make sure to visit all the amazing geologic formations and beautiful scenic vistas!  Fort Rock, Hole-In-The-Ground, Crack-In-The-Ground, are just a few examples!  
We have an annual pilgrimage out here every November... We call it 'The Fall Classic'.  A large group of friends driving primarily Suzuki 4x4 vehicles, travel out here together to 'freeze our buns off' while enjoying good company and making great memories.  We hope you enjoy your visit!</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>You should climb and descend while looking for an obvious hiding place.  Not too close to camp, but not too far away.  It won't be in clear sight, but won't take much to uncover.  Small animals may find shelter near by!</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

"x4" was the hardest to find of the series for me. "x6" was laying on the ground so i put it back where it needed to be. "x12" is covered with biting red ants so watch out.

nobody around which is always pleasant. no critters. roads are soft and washboardy. weather was getting hotter than i enjoy.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Headed south early again this morning to get some more of CO's caches south of Paulina Peak before the projected snow flies this weekend. The temperature was in the teens when I left Redmond and remained very cold throughout the day. However, the sun was shining and there wasn't any wind so the cold was bearable. Made the loop of the AL series of caches, picked up a couple of others as well and then did the loop of the X series with a couple of back tracks. 

Headed down the seldom used track in an attempt to get the next 4 caches in the X series but ran into a large tree across the road trying to get to this one so turned around with the idea I would approach from the other side after picking up #5. As it turned out, there was another tree down on that road as well between # 5 and #4. Appears that some people had driven off road to get around that tree, but I decided to park and took the short hike to get this cache. TFTC. SL</groundspeak:text>

I wonder how a lot of GC are so rarely found around here !!! Nice to be "Fourth to find" after so many months !!!

In my old Europe :) GC are found very often and it is a kind of race to be FTF ;-D
Even in deep forests or difficult to reach places...

Anyway, thanks again to all owners In the State where it all belonged !</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Headed south early again this morning to get some more of CO's caches south of Paulina Peak before the projected snow flies this weekend. The temperature was in the teens when I left Redmond and remained very cold throughout the day. However, the sun was shining and there wasn't any wind so the cold was bearable. Made the loop of the AL series of caches, picked up a couple of others as well and then did the loop of the X series with a couple of back tracks. 

Headed down the seldom used track in an attempt to get the next 4 caches in the X series but ran into a large tree across the road trying to get to #4 so turned around with the idea I would approach from the other side after picking up this cache. As it turned out, there was another tree down on that road as well between # 5 and #4. Appears that some people had driven off road to get around that tree, but I decided to park and took the short hike to get #4. TFTC. SL</groundspeak:text>

"x4" was the hardest to find of the series for me. "x6" was laying on the ground so i put it back where it needed to be. "x12" is covered with biting red ants so watch out.

nobody around which is always pleasant. no critters. roads are soft and washboardy. weather was getting hotter than i enjoy.</groundspeak:text>

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;It had been years since I had traveled this back road from Bend to Fort Rock. The road has been much improved, so it is travelable by passenger car. There are several caches along the way. The location is called Cabin Lake, but don't bother bringing your bathing suit. By the entrance to the nearby ranger station there is a decrepit boat. It brought to mind a scene from the movie "Holes". I had lunch within vew of this cache, at a rustic picnic table shaded by a pine tree. The container is a 6X6 lock-lock box, painted in unhelpful colors.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Great place to take a hike, swim and slide. The cache is at the starting point of the hike. Cache is a LARGE Bison Tube (3") placed almost 6 feet of the ground high enough to be accesible even with a large amount of snow. Short .2 mile walk to cache on a large dirt road.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The cache is really a starting point for a great hike or bike ride to swimming holes, waterfalls and even two waterslides. This is the do it yourself version of the Paulina Plunge. If you want a guided tour Google Paulina Plunge.

If you hike the route one way it is 4.5 miles almost completely downhill. Biking it is mostly downhill but with some walking involved to get to two of the waterfalls and slides, check the waypoints.

Instructions for trip:
- Park one car at McKay Crossing, end of hike\bike.
- Park second car at 10 Mile Snow Park, starting point.
- Walk\Bike to Cache and take the small trail going west.
- Trail comes out at Waypoint HIKE1 - Turn off for hiking at this point Hikers and Bikers go different directions.
-- Bikers continue down dirt road and stop at BSWK01 and BSWK2 and look for small trails going down to creek. I left my bike on the road and walked down to water. Trail is narrow and steep for biking.
-- Hikers look for small trail heading down the hill at HIKE1 (North) to water. Once at the creek look for bridge, walk over bridge and stay on trail going west which will take you to all waterfalls and waterslides.

There are two water slides at the WSLIDE (WaterSlide 1 &amp; 2) the upper one is a large slide into a pool and the other one is father down the creek.

Have fun and go swimming on a hot day. Let me know how the directions worked for you. OTazMan

Take that 2 digit number and add it to the North coord.  then add 23.  Now you have a new North coord.   Next find the OHV regulations, ATV sticker.  Take the first 2 digit number and add that to the West coord.  Now you have a new West coord.  
Go and you will find a medium size micro .  So BYOP.

We had a pill bottle and page from a field book, please bring your own pen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Cache along the Peter Skene Ogden Trail.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;For the last eight years I’ve been volunteering with the U.S. Geological Survey during the summer as a field assistant to help with the geologic mapping of Newberry Volcano. Today, I was working along the Peter Skene Ogden Trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulina Creek is undersized for the features found along the channel, it’s average annual discharge is 18 cubic feet per second. Between 2000 and 4000 years ago a small waterfall reached Paulina Lake and dropped the lake’s level by about 8 feet. This resulted in a flood with an estimated discharge rate of about 7000 cubic feet per second (almost 400 times the annual rate). The flood lasted no more than two days. This flood formed the many large scale features found along Paulina Creek. Here at this location there was a single falls over 150 feet wide with water about 10 feet deep across the entire falls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, at this location Paulina Creek is about 8 feet wide and drops about 12-foot to form what I call Pipeline Falls. The name Pipeline Falls comes from an old nearby wood-stave pipeline which supplied water to the old logging railroad camp of Shevlin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This waterfall is waymarked at waymarking.com as are several other falls along Paulina Creek.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

As it turns out, some of the roads are closed for the season already. This was our ninth stop of the day and fourth and last stop on our 4 mile hike to find the four caches in the area. Great location for a cache and made it a favorite. TFTH. TNLNSL</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Awesome falls! Liked the carved out cave across the creek. Almost looks man made. Took a dog break upstream and noticed an old metal seat in a tree uphill. Climbed up and figured it might be a deer tree stand fastened by a chain.? Still had a seat cushion on it with some 70's looking carpet. Neat artifact. Almost looked like an old road up top.

nobody around which is always pleasant. no critters. roads are soft and washboardy. weather was getting hotter than i enjoy.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">This is a "snow proof" cache and best done on a pair of show shoes.
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">My most favorite caches are those where a fellow Geocacher shares a favorite activity in a favorite place ... and that's exactly what I'm gonna do with this one. This cache is located at one of our favorite destinations while wearing a pair of snowshoes. It's not too long of a hike (about 2 miles round trip) from 10-Mile Snow Park, which is on the road up to Newberry Cauldera, and the cache is stashed near a sunny spot right above a waterfall on Paulina Creek. So grab your gear, load up a backpack with a picnic lunch and head north out of 10-Mile Snowpark (parking permit required in winter) to the power line, which is snowmobile Trail #11. Turn west (downhill) and hike down the road under the power line (Trail #11) to the listed "Trailhead" waypoint. If the snow isn't too deep you will find a trailhead sign here that sends you north down into the creek canyon on a singletrack, where you will find a footbridge to cross the creek. This trek is perfectly doable on a pair of skis too, except for that last couple hundred yards down into the creek canyon. Both the cache and the sunny spot for that picnic lunch are on the north side of the creek. The cache's hiding spot is "snow proof" as long as it doesn't get much deeper than about 4' or 5'. I'm sure this location will attract it's share of summertime visitors too, and whether you come on foot or on bike the Peter Skeen Ogden trail leading here is mind boggleing. If you do come on bike please remember that the Peter Skeen Ogden trail is uphill only for bikes ... but you can start at McKay or the Group Camp trailheads and ride up to here, cross the creek and ride the power line road back down to where you started. I've left a disposable camera here in hopes that you will take a picture of yourselve(s) and leave it there for the next finder. Please let me know when the picture counter gets down to zero. I've also left a nice Geocaching bumper sticker for the FTF reward. Congrats to markellie for FTF ... and thanks for the fav point!

saw a couple of deer plus about 100 bikers at the snopark when i got back. they were all getting their orientation to bike down the powerline road for a pick up at ogden group camp.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;For several years i have seen this unusual site while hunting or rideing the ATVs, every time i went by this spot i would say, i am going to walk over there and see what or how this happened. While out again today i finally decided it was time to investigate and plant a cache for others to also enjoy. DONOT just go and sign the log and leave. The rock formations here are some of Gods best work. I took 2 pictures of the type of rocks you will see, The entire area (rock formations) are made from from these types of rocks. It is about a&amp;nbsp;100&amp;nbsp;yard walk to the cache site and well worth the time it will take to drive all the way to Quartz Mountain. The terrain is very loose and the formations very brittle, only do if you feel comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;For the last eight years I’ve been volunteering with the U.S. Geological Survey during the summer as a field assistant to help with the geologic mapping of Newberry Volcano. Today, I was working along the Peter Skene Ogden Trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulina Creek is undersized for the features found along the channel, it’s average annual discharge is 18 cubic feet per second. Between 2000 and 4000 years ago a small waterfall reached Paulina Lake and dropped the lake’s level by about 8 feet. This resulted in a flood with an estimated discharge rate of about 7000 cubic feet per second (almost 400 times the annual rate). The flood lasted no more than two days. This flood formed the many large scale features found along Paulina Creek. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, near this location Paulina Creek there are two nice falls within about 300 feet of each other which were carved by the flood. The nearest one, I call Pool Falls for the large plunge pool beneath it’s 15 foot drop. I call the second falls drops which about 12 feet about 300 feet upstream, Double Falls for the two adjacent falls which spill over the same basalt ledge. Image what these falls would have looked like during the flood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These waterfalls are both waymarked at waymarking.com as are several other falls along Paulina Creek.&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">parked at 10 mile snopark and from there used a combination of bike travel and/or foot travel. started fairly early with the temps in the high 50's and finished a couple of hours later with the temps in the low 70's. skies for the most part remained mostly cloudy so all my physical work was fairly cool. 

saw a couple of deer plus about 100 bikers at the snopark when i got back. they were all getting their orientation to bike down the powerline road for a pick up at ogden group camp.</groundspeak:text>

Today one of our hikes took us to the top of Orphan Butte. There is a great view from the summit.  There are multiple routes of access to the summit, but some are easier than others due to brush and down trees from the 1988 Paulina Fire.  The cache container is pill bottle so bring your own pin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

So, we drove along Orphan Butte Rd 1830 until we were south of the cache and able to park (and turn around).  Then it was a matter of picking our way uphill through the toothpick forest and manzanita to a cache with a great view -- a reward for scaling the butte in the 90-degree heat.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another addition to our Oregon Fire Lookout list and an addition to the possibilities for the &lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=b65a315f-c7a3-46f0-b2bb-4dca07411862"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;font color="#00447C"&gt;Oregon Forest Fire Lookout Challenge&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">There is nothing left of the original fire lookout that was within feet of this cache, but the views to the south and west are AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lookout was built in 1931, it was an L-4 cab built on the ground. In 1948 the ground house was moved to Fox Butte where it can be seen today.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We placed this cache on March 23rd, took USFS Road 23 to within about a mile of the cache. The road was very soft but passable. Once we got to road 2268 things changed very fast. The road looked fine, but in fact it was about 3 inches of mud on top of ice in the best spots. Even in 4 wheel drive we quickly learned that the road was not going to support any kind of vehicle traffic. Evidence of this can be seen if you look close at the nearby trees and the mud on them from shotgun going sideways in a power slide for a good 200 feet. We did finally find a spot (just short of a grand big mud hole) where we could stop, turn around and head back to the intersection with road 23.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the dry months however, you can get right to the base of the road/trail that goes up to the top. This road would be considered a OHV trail and from what we could see through the snow, not passable for any full sized vehicle, high clearance/4 wheel drive or not. Will be interesting if someone can prove us wrong!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway, the best bet is to park at the start of the trail and walk the .5 mile or so up to the top. A little stress on the heart and legs is always a good thing when chasing LOT caches. Makes you appreciate them even more!!! Take some time on top, like mentioned before, the views of Christmas Valley and beyond are amazing!!!

I wonder how a lot of GC are so rarely found around here !!!

Quick and easy find for the cache and we did get a good view of Paulina Peak, Mt. Scott, Fort Rock and Mt Hager.  Things where kinda hazy but still easy enough to spot.

Inked and Replaced.

Was a nice sunny day with temperatures in the mid 60's perfect for hiking lookouts.  Winds were blowing about 10-15 with stronger gust but all in all a great day.  Nice views from the top especially to the South and West.  30 down and 20 to go so I had better get with it.  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

Eric entered active military service in the United States Marine Corps in 1990, and honorably served his country reaching the rank of Corporal. He received the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for Heroism by the President of the United States during the time he served.  The number 31 was very significant in his life he was in the 31st squadron of the marines and it was the type of helicopter he was in when it crashed killing all on board except him.  Being a avid outdoorsman he only recently discovered a passion for motorcycle riding. This is the last area he rode in. We hope when you hunt for this Cache you will stop and enjoy the beauty of this area as we know he did.

While on a ATV ride on trail 60 i saw a TeePee someone had built, i walked over to take a look and said, this is a good spot to place a cache. Cache is West of the TeePee about 15 or so feet. You are looking for a Large bison tube.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is a straight forward single point cache, the challenge is in reaching the site. The ammo can is placed in a shadowy smooth walled cavity so a light might be helpful.  Not covered by any rocks.  Depending on route chosen it is an absolute minimum of a 2 mile round trip with no trail.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;I met Homer the Troll while exploring the southern end of the Lava Cascade 
  Flow. He’s been very lonely living up there and asked me to make travel arrangement 
  for him through the Travel Bug Agency. He is inviting everyone to come up and 
  spend some time at his home while he is gone. He also needs the first visitor 
  to get him started on his travels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Homer has two suggestions for routes to access his home:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;Park near N 43° 47.147 W 121° 16.026, along Rd 9735. This is a minimum 
      2 miles round trip with 700’ of elevation gain. There are steep loose rocky 
      slopes to climb along this route. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;Park near N 43° 46.997 W 121° 14.058, along Rd 9710. This is a minimum 
      3 miles round trip with 400’ of elevation gain. There is a lot of lodgepole 
      blow down near Rd 9710 and some steep vegetated side slopes to cross.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a map of the area and some photos to help along with the hint below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homer's Home is located near the southern end of the Lava Cascade Flow. From 
  his home there is a great view of Mt. Jefferson and Mt. Hood. The view also 
  includes Lava Butte, Mokst Butte, the Lava Cast Forest Flow, and the Lava Cascade 
  Flow which are all about 7000 years old and form part of the NW Rift Zone of 
  Newberry Volcano. The rift zone extends from Lava Butte to The Dome southeast 
  of East Lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the winter you can easily see the location of Homer's Home from Bend.  During the winter there is a large white (snow covered) scar high on the north flank of Newberry Volcano.  Homer's Home is at the top of that white scar.&lt;'p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

I'm not sure why this cache doesn't get more visits, but it is well worth the trip.  I came in from 1.40 miles to the east on a relatively level path and actually came out onto the flow well above the cache.  The view was spectacular!  Thanks for another great adventure.  

Lonely no more. [:D]

I was able to glass the location from the top of a cinder butte nearby and I could see that the lights were off, the door was closed and the cover was securely on the BBQ...so I guess all is well for now.

Looking forward to returning soon to check the plumbing.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Finally got my butt up here. I think the drive was more of a workout than the hike. Saw nothing except for a lone elk on the road near Pilpil Butte. Followed the old road to the old deer camp and then started the bushwacking. Not as bad as I thought it might be.  Came to the lava flow a couple hundred feet above the cache and checked out all the vent holes on the way down to the big one. Sat down for a spell and took in the glory. Spent an extra hour roaming the area looking for some more of those cool spear heads but saw nothing. To this day I still have not found one. Another rockin Volcanoguy cache.</groundspeak:text>

 There was just enough snow not to go any farther on the side road. Map showed the road ended up ahead anyway. Parked from this spot and walked up the hill to take a look around. Enjoy the leg/lung rush and the view from this one.</groundspeak:long_description>

Well there certainly was a lot of manzanita, but I bucked the advice below and wore my shorts.  I drew no blood [8D] But I would agree jeans are more approbate...

Weather may limit the cache site if the Main road is snowed in, please keep this in mind as the cell service out here is spotty at best.&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We still like to get out looking for lookout caches.  If fact, lookouts are just about the only caches we do anymore.  

It was a great day to get out.  We dodged hunters all day on this first day of rifle season.  They had shut off road 830 so we hiked in the mile to the top.  The lookout was vacant but that may have been the lookout that drove up by us on our way out.  As I climbed the tower, the wind steadily picked up to a small gale.  Interesting outstructures around the area also.  Sorry to see no Tom Fuller up here.

We had planned to go to Bald Butte but chose instead to go to the top of closeby Big Hole lookout.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">We set a few caches out here for our ATV friends.  This is best found by ATVing in to it.  It is on trail 60, not far from the 2510 staging area. Could be hiked to from 2510 staging area, though.  Bring H2O if you hike it.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is a medium sized camo covered round tin.  We put these up for the ATVers out there.  We love to geocache, and ride, so we wanted to help Lost-a-Pair get some caches out there.  Not far off the trail.  Can park ATVs right by there.  Staging area has parking for other rigs.

This is our first cache, so bear with us as we work out any problems.  I'm sure you'll let us know if we don't have things right. Named because Gramma started us all in on geocaching.

ATVEZ took a photo of us at our first cache.  It really gives away the cache location.  Don't look until you have found the cache, or if you need a REALLY big hint.  Thanks for the photo, though!</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;Is this Felix, the cat? And if so, why is a limb missing? Just
before the 6 miles sign you'll notice a figure standing in the
forest. Finally I got around to investigate and just had to place a
little cache a few meters off Felix, the cat. But let me pose the
question to you, fellow cachers - what happened here? Why is there
a cat in the forest and what happened to the missing limb? Please
add a few lines in your log with your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

TFTC ! From a french geocacheur visiting Oregon for the very first time :)

I wonder how a lot of GC are so rarely found around here !!!

In my old Europe :) GC are found very often and it is a kind of race to be FTF ;-D
Even in deep forests or difficult to reach places...

Anyway, thanks again to all owners In the State where it all belonged !</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Those with a new nail job should not be swimming… nor look for cache at posted coordinates.So, what are the nail fashion fads going to be for this coming fall… Who knows… Interestingly, a unique spin on the Reverse French Manicure appeared last year all over the runways from Tracy Reese to Christian Dior. It was a perfect fit for both the short dress with boots or the sculpted skirt with heels. Unlike the Reverse French Manicures of past trends, which show white nails with black or red tips, this season’s Reverse French takes an avant guard turn with black nails and white tips or a half moon curved ivory bottom to the nail with the rest of the nail black.

I was a little worried I might not find it after about 20 minutes even slowly expanding my search radius. Apparently I wasn't thorough enough as I finally spotted it in that one little sliver of the "pie" I didn't quite reach before - and only 20 feet from coords. From here I went cross country towards the SW for another couple of caches looping back to starting point. Thanks for the fun.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I have had this one solved for quite a while but timing never worked out for me to get out and grab it. This time we were headed down here, I remember this cache a decided to make it a priority.  However, when I looked at the puzzle, I could not remember how I solved it. Then when I remembered it turns out I had  one of my numbers wrong--how could that be?  Finally, when looking at the logs before we headed out today, I realized that the CO had actually changed them slightly.  I didn't think to ask the CO about that when we hiked together a few days ago.

After reading about the hike in and the approach, I did ask him about the approach. He alluded to it being a hike so I was expecting much worse. We followed a road most of the way in and the final 200 ft. was just sort of an inconvenience.  We actually found the hike in quick and easy.  The search took us a while but more because it took some time for our GPSr's to settle.  Once they did, we found the cache almost immediately.  One unit said 3 ft. at GZ, the other said 4.

It is ironic that I can add this one to my extreme lonely cache list since I just hiked out to grab that cache challege with the CO a few days ago.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Another addition to our Oregon Fire Lookout list. The nearby
Benchmark (the concrete post is still there in bad shape, but the
disk itself is missing) was described by the US Forest Service in
1934 as:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">THIS INTERSECTED POSITION IS THE CENTER OF AN ABANDONED LUMBER
COMPANY LOOKOUT TOWER BUILT IN A TREE ON THE SUMMIT OF MC KAY
BUTTE, ABOUT 4 MILES NE OF LAPINE. THE BUTTE HAS AN ELEVATION OF
5254 FEET, AND IS REACHED BY FOREST ROADS FROM THE PAULINA LAKE
ROAD WHICH EXTENDS E FROM THE DALLES-CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY N OF
LAPINE. IN 1935 IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE TREE WAS IN BAD CONDITION.
THE U.S.F.S. HAS SET A REFERENCE MARK CONSISTING OF A DISK IN A
CONCRETE POST, 5.64 METERS (18.5 FEET) S OF THE STATION.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The best way to this one from McKay Campground and follow road
9736. Turn right on spur 300 and then left to start up the butte.
At about .25 miles from the top there are trees down across the
road, this is a great place to turn around and start walking. An
easy hike to the top. Not to sure about the views from here as it
was snowing when we placed the cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cache is a peanut butter type plastic jar hidden in a small stump
and covered with a flat piece of wood and pine needles. Please
rehide as you find it!&lt;br /&gt;

We will probably never get to all of them, but we''ll get the ones in the areas we visit.  We had a very pleasant walk up and were pleasantly surprised that the roads back here allowed for an easy drive on to several other caches we had earmarked in the area.  Luckily, the hard rain held off until we were finished caching for the day.  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

If you did Weasel Won, you're looking for an identical 2qt Tupperware-type container. This one actually has swag in it, along with an offical Weasel Can Coozie for the FTF (if you want it). Launched the Snoopster Travel Bug with this cache.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Cookie's Kitchen was prepared with the lady cachers in mind.  It is an ammo can very very close to a FS Road (#400) off the 23 Road.  The road definitely has it's "ups and downs" and a bit difficult to travel, but it is accessible with a high clearance vehicle.  Our advice would be to walk in from the 23 road approximately .40 miles.  It will be a bit difficult to turn around if you decide to drive in and can't make it (or don't want to!) A small 4WD pick up is your best bet if you don't want to walk in.  

Remember to bring a small kitchen trading item.</groundspeak:long_description>

TFTC ! From a french geocacheur visiting Oregon for the very first time :)

I wonder how a lot of GC are so rarely found around here !!!

In my old Europe :) GC are found very often and it is a kind of race to be FTF ;-D
Even in deep forests or difficult to reach places...

Anyway, thanks again to all owners In the State where it all belonged !</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The cache is located near the summit of a cinder cone in the largest kipuka in the 7000 year old Lava Cascade Flow.  Kipukas are areas of older rock that are surrounded by younger lava flows.  There are 14 significant kipukas plus a number of smaller kipukas, some less than 10 feet across, within the area covered by the Lava Cast and Lava Cascade Flows.  The flow was erupted from the spatter vents visible to the ESE. 

This is another location I discovered while doing volunteer work for the U.S. Geological Survey.  From here there is a view to the west, south, and east. Much of the view to the south and east is of the upper north flank of Newberry Volcano.  The large cinder cone visible to the southeast across the southern arm of the Lava Cascade Flow is locally known as North Kawak Butte and is the source of a large flow that went to the west over five miles.  The flow is pre-Mazama in age (more than 7,700 years old) and is tree covered due to the 2 to 3 feet of Mazama Pumice that covers the flow.

The cache is a standard ammo can. Depending on route chosen it is a minimum of at least a 1 mile round trip. You will need to cross an arm of the Lava Cascade Flow, an advanced look at maps will minimize the amount of lava that needs to be crossed.</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">What a beautiful day...really sorry I forgot to bring my camera along.  Volcanoguy caches are always worth the trip. 

I found the short side of the cinder cone for the ascent, but the bush wacking was pretty intense at times on that side.  Actually it was kind of like running into Wes Welker across the middle...it shouldn't really affect you, but...

Found the cache, and took in the view for a while before signing the log and rescuing the travel bug. 

Thanks,

Decided this cache doesn't have the correct name. It should have been called the Geocache Triathalon. The first stage is .18 miles of "take it easy" rock hopping, the second stage is .30 miles of hurdles over downed lodgepole "pick up sticks" and the last stage is .10 miles of 300 ft. cardio climb. A cacher can get whatever he wants on this cache. Hiked 1.53 mi. in 1:25 min. with total accent of 301 ft. TFTH. TNL[b][pink]"Dubble Bubble"[/b][/pink] SL</groundspeak:text>

You'll have to guess at the names I called you. Grabbed the TB so it wont get entombed here til next summer. I guess I'll say thanks but not sure if I really mean it.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Located a nice parking slot off the 9735 road at N43 47.269 W121 17.147  We crossed the first of three narrow necks of lava (0.16 mile) leading to Palindrome in 10 minutes and arrived at the Cinder cache in the steady drizzle in 30 minutes.  Located a pile of fresh black bear scat 50 ft north of this cache (picture). Never saw the bear(s) nor any other native 4-legged critters.

Have a look at the posted JPG showing our complete route and you can likely select an easier route that avoids the numerous windfall Lodgepoles.  Dropped a TB into the cache to entice others to enjoy this easy hike.  Nearby is Homer's Home, another excellent cache that will take you high up to the start of the Lava Cast flow.  Make a day of these three caches, doing Homer in the morning and finishing with this Kipuka and nearby Palindrome caches.

Overall, the Rino 130 showed 1257 vertical gain for the entire duo cache hunt over a moving time of 2hrs 10 minutes, 3.8 miles.  You can return to 97 at Lava Butte via the 9710 road one mile to the east of our parking site.  This reroute might save you 10-15 minutes from the backtrack down 9735 to 97 and then north past SR to Bend.

Given the many places to hide, I wonder about placing this cache in a location with three not so good elements. If you slip, there's a price to pay. If this gets even medium traffic, I'm guessing there will be definite erosion of moss nicely colored moss. There are a few guardians in the form of sticker bushes to negotiate. But, it's Aces for bringing you to a nice overlook.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">This is a multi-point cache that involves about a mile of walking round trip.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">You should be able to drive to N 43° 45.916’  W 121° 21.841’ from there it is a short walk to the starting point where a small (3”x2”x1/2”) metal tin will provide the coordinates and clue to the next point.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The second point is also a small metal tin.  From this point there is a good view of Mt. Bachelor, the Three Sisters, and Broken Top.  This point is located on an example of inverted topography.  At one time there was a stream channel here, which was cut into easily eroded volcanic deposits.  A lava flow then filled the channel and later erosion removed the surrounding volcanic deposits.  Resulting in what was once a stream bottom becoming a ridge top (inverted topography).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The cache (and the starting point) is located on an exposure of a welded tuff resulting from one of the large eruptions that formed Newberry Crater (actually a caldera) about 5 miles southeast of here.  From near the cache there is a view of the Cascade crest from Diamond Peak northward to Sheridan Mountain (south of Mt. Bachelor).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The cache is in an ammo box and the original contents  included:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log book, pencils, and sharpener.
&lt;li&gt;Golf ball
&lt;li&gt;Screw driver
&lt;li&gt;Toy car
&lt;li&gt;Bungie cord
&lt;li&gt;Ball
&lt;li&gt;Tape measure key chain

They make for a perfect place to sit and use the binoculars. Thank you Volcanoguy for hiding this old cache. 
The two WP's and final worked out just fine. Tried this cache once before but the road was blocked. Glad to finally find your fine cache after all these years.

FAVORITE  !

P.S. Wish I wore jeans. Got me a case of the bushwacking shins.</groundspeak:text>

This is a really cool area and I enjoyed the exploring. I had some trouble finding WP 2, but that was my fault for not looking at the clue when I got the coords. The view from 2 was awesome! The cache is dry and in great shape and offers yet another beautiful view. It's a shame this cache doesn't get more finds. I feel like it's gotten a bad rap for difficulty. While there is some bushwacking and there are a couple of steep spots, they are short and remember the whole hike is only a mile! Thanks for the great hike Volcanoguy! I'm looking forward to doing the Sugarpine caches.</groundspeak:text>

I guess it is all perspective, but, after all of the climbing, bushwacking, and hiking, we thought it was under rated.  It appears the others who have found this thought so, also. I think your log book will provide you with many comments and details.  The second piece was literally on the ground, rusted shut. We pried it open, cleaned it up and stashed it where we thought it may have been, at some point. Overall, this was quite an adventure for us! The views were amazing, even though the workout was not quite what we were led to believe. It was our first multi and we will continue to do more! This was an interesting part of our end of the season camping weekend. We did leave with a BIG smile on our faces! Great challenge :)  We signed the log and left our usual, a black cat shape.</groundspeak:text>

We started the short cruise over from Jedi but when the 2nd lightning storm came in suddenly from the south, Special K decided that he should be a good dad and get a fairly distraught Kidzilla back up to camp as quickly as he could.  He sent his pen to the cache with PartOfTheProblem so that we'd be there in some form to sign the log.  Close enough, we hope.  Great views on this southern spur trek, by the way.

After finding this one, the only one left for us to find is "Hellfeather". 
The last (and only) time we were on this ridge was 7 or 8 years ago when we were looking for cat food cans. It took us a couple years to find most of those cans. [:D]
The hike back up was long and slow. We seem to be getting older, or maybe it's just this thin air that we are not used to. [;)] Thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The cache is a standard ammo can. Depending on route chosen it is a minimum of about 2.5 miles round trip with about a mile along a trail.  You will need to cross several lava flows.  One place to begin from is at the Hoffman Island trailhead on the road to Lava Cast Forest.

A palindrome is a set of numbers that are the same when read frontward or backward, so for this set of coordinates:

43 48112 121 18434

The location of this set of coordinates falls near the west edge of a kipuka (area surrounded by younger lava flows) within the 7000 year old Lava Cascades Flow.  Be sure to climb up onto the flow and enjoy the view.</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Another very cool area...and again I forgot my camera. 

I came down from the cinder cone and had to laugh about the multiple "how are we going to find or truck" logs.  I felt the same way and had a vision of a village of lost geocachers somewhere nearby.

I am curious about the name of this lava flow.  Does it have anything to do with the way the lava cascades down through the various peaks and valleys? 

Thanks for another great hide,  TNLNSL

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Got to the Palindrome after trekking over from Cinder cache.  Total moving time was one hour from the rig.  Took a brain puzzle and left some jewelry.  Suspected that an approach from Lava Cast Forest would involve about the same amount of vertical gain, but would require a bit more lava travel.  No signs of bear beyond the scat at Cinder and overturned rocks along towards Palindrome.

Located a nice parking slot off the 9735 road at N43 47.269 W121 17.147  We crossed the first of three narrow necks of lava (0.16 mile) leading to Palindrome in 10 minutes and arrived at the Cinder cache in the steady drizzle in 30 minutes.  Located a pile of fresh black bear scat 50 ft north of this cache (picture). Never saw the bear(s) nor any other native 4-legged critters.

Have a look at the posted JPG showing our complete route and you can likely select an easier route that avoids the numerous windfall Lodgepoles.  Dropped a TB into the cache to entice others to enjoy this easy hike.  Nearby is Homer's Home, another excellent cache that will take you high up to the start of the Lava Cast flow.  Make a day of these three caches, doing Homer in the morning and finishing with this Kipuka and nearby Palindrome caches.

Overall, the Rino 130 showed 1257 vertical gain for the entire duo cache hunt over a moving time of 2hrs 10 minutes, 3.8 miles.  You can return to 97 at Lava Butte via the 9710 road one mile to the east of our parking site.  This reroute might save you 10-15 minutes from the backtrack down 9735 to 97 and then north past SR to Bend.</groundspeak:text>

This should be looked at as a fast cache and dash seeing as it is only about 100 feet off the road in a flat area without any brush, cliffs, blow down thickets, etc.

I went in driving my little rice grinder rig so you should be able to make it easy.  After the snow is off, the town car can make it to this cache.

According to Rex's web page, the cabin was in a 80 foot tree and was still there in 1997. I did not find any trace left of the tower but you never know what you will find after the snow is off the ground.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The trail begins from a small parking area (N 43:49.076  W 121:18.183) and is a normal trail for the first 0.1 miles to where it begins following an old Shevlin-Hixon logging railroad grade built in the early 1930’s.  The grade crosses the Lava Cast Forest Flow where if you are observant you may discover a couple tree molds (lava casts) for which the area is well known.  From the end of the railroad grade you will need to make a short steep climb and then walk a short distance out on to the Lava Cascade Flow.

From the cache location there is a view of the Oregon Cascades and a view a lava cascade.  The lava cascade you will be standing on is the northern most (and largest) of eight for which the Lava Cascade Flow is named.  The timber islands to the south are kipukas and are completely surrounded by the Lava Cascade Flow.  On the right at the base of the lava cascade the Lava Cast Forest Flow can be see joining with the Lava Cascade Flow.  These flows are both about 7000 years old and were active at the same time.

Besure to check out the TopoZone map link below.

The holes  were drilled to obtain a oriented core for paleomagnetic studies. When the lava cooled it locked in the orientation of the geomagnetic field at the time of the flow. Multiple holes are drill to improve the statistical accuracy of the final result. Different flows that have the same paleomagnetic orientation are the same age.

Question for Volcanoguy ... after making the short but steep climb and starting the trek out into the lava I came across several small lava tubes that had about a 1/2" hole drilled (obviously man and machine made holes) in some of the rock near the entrance.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This cache is located on the north side of Newberry Volcano at an elevation of about 5,850 feet.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">For the last few years I’ve been volunteering with the U.S. Geological Survey as a field assistant to help with the mapping of Newberry Volcano.  This week I was working in the Lava Cast Forest area and one of my tasks involved a hike around Klone Butte. Just northeast of Klone Butte is a small spatter cone chain which I refer to as the Little Klone chain.  This cache is located near the summit of one of the cones. 

Klone Butte, this spatter cone chain, and a dozen other vents scattered over the north flank of Newberry produced a series of late glacial lava flows (approximately 10,000 to 13,000 years ago).  The eruptive episode was probably similar to the NW Rift Zone eruption 7,000 years ago which produced the flows extending from Lava Butte south to the East Lake Fissure and the Surveyors Flow on the south flank of Newberry.

Twenty years ago you could have driven fairly close to this cache, but today the roads shown on maps are closed by down trees and overgrown with trees. Depending on where you start from you will need to walk about a mile and a half round trip to reach this location. The cache is a screw cap plastic container.</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">since i didn't get this one last week i came back.  different conditions this week.  parked at lava cast forest and headed out thru about 3-4 inches of snow and a bit of blowdown.

kind of got off course a bit and started going up big klone butte but quickly realized my mistake and corrected course.  absolutely nobody around but a few rabbit tracks were seen.

enjoyed the cache location and figured this would be the toughest hike of the day and i was correct.</groundspeak:text>

Made the trip over from Swampy Wells cache and tried three different roads before deciding which one to take.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU LOCK/SEAL BOTH SIDES OF CACHE BOX TIGHT; iT DOES SNOW HERE (A LOT), AND THE WIND DOES GET REALLY GUSTY AND MIGHT BLOW TOP OFF IF BOTH SIDES ARENT SECURED/LOCKED, AND PREFER NOT HAVING TO REPLACING BOX (and/or items inside) IF IT GETS WET INSIDE. THE CACHE BOX UNLOCKS/OPENS ON BOTH SIDES ON TOP, PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU CLOSE/LOCK BOTH SIDES BEFORE YOU LEAVE. Thank you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought that this would be a great day hike/caching trip. It is about 1/3 of a mile up the road from the trailhead. Please make sure to wear comfortable hiking shoes and enough water (it is a decent hike). The cache is near a nice waterfall with a nice swimming hole; so bring your swimming clothes if you'd like, and weather permitting of course. The cache container is hidden behind a tree. It isnt camoflauged (so you dont have to overturn sticks or rocks, it is just hidden from trail view; so please make sure if you find it, you leave it where it is, so it wont be seen by non-geocachers. If you've made it above the waterfall, you've gone too far. Cache is a medium sized military ammo box (about the size of shoe box for hiking boots). There is plenty of space in the cache for "larger" items, but make sure it isnt too large though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be advised, during the first week of August every year, there is a camping "convention" that goes on at the group camp, and some of the campers go to the waterfall and skinny dip in the waterfall swimming hole (they do wear clothing to and from the area, just not in the water). So if you are bringing the kiddies (or if nudity bothers you), either choose a different time to cache, or try to redirect their eyes from the waterfall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be accessible during winter, but It might be buried under snow depending on how much snow accumulates. I will not be able to restock supplies after snow fall (as I dont have proper hiking/snowshoeing equipment to go out) . during late fall-early spring, please make sure you byop just incase.&lt;/p&gt;

I've been on the PSO trail many times, but never realized there was also a trail on the other side of the river. So Doug crossed on a log, and I waded. Simple find. The ammo can was NOT locked on one side but the contents were fine. It is locked on both sides now. TNLN. Ambled over to the falls. Very nice, I've never seen these falls before.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">We spotted this magnificent old dead tree while exploring around the Fox Butte area. It's in a beautiful clearing just off of the road. A great place to stop for lunch. While looking for likely spot to hide the cache I saw a plaque on the tree that said "Wildlife tree - saved for their food and shelter". &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;h2&gt;Wildlife trees&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Standing dead trees are often considered dangerous eyesores in need of prompt removal. Actually, they play such an important role in wildlife ecology that it is often said they "give life to the forest."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Usually called snags, den trees or cavity trees, biologists are increasingly calling standing dead or dying trees "wildlife trees" in recognition of their enormous value to birds and other creatures. Biologists know that, in the wild, they provide food, safe nesting sites in the form of cavities and platforms, roosting and denning sites, hunting perches, display stations, and foraging sites for a wide variety of species.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How cool is that! I hope you enjoy this spot as much as we did.</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Found it, but started to think we wouldn't get there.  My daughter was starting to wonder what she had signed up for.  I too, had kept admiring the rocky bluff from a far and wanted to get closer to check them out.  We were working on the last of Asterope's 7 sisters and thought "Shoot, its only .45 miles from here.  we can make that and still get back in time for the pot-luck BBQ."  Well... what felt more like 4.5 miles later, we made it around the east side of the ridge doing lots of rock hopping with lots of great pictures and tired legs.  It was hard, but worth all the great sights and unusual rock formations.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The starting coordinates will put you in the parking area for the Lava Cast Forest, which is a Recreation Fee Site requiring a parking pass. Area is usually accessable from mid-May to mid-November.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is the first in a series of eight Earthcaches being developed at major points of interest in Newberry National Volcanic Monument in cooperation with the staff of the Deschutes National Forest. This EarthCache is located along a one mile paved trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need a tape measure to gather the information to log this cache. To log this cache post a photo of your favorite feature along the trail and e-mail me the answers to the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At trail marker post #6 there is a single elipical shape tree mold. What are the minimum and maximum diameters (in inches) of this mold?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At trail marker post #8 there are three tree molds. What are the diameters (in inches) of these molds?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At trail marker post #10 there is a horizontal tree mold. What is the length (in feet) of the mold?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While doing this earthcache you may also be able to collect the necessary information to claim several waymarks in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.earthcache.org" title="Earthcache Portal"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.geosociety.org/Earthcache/pageGraphics/earthcache_32.gif" border="0" alt /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This area was discovered by Walter Perry of the Forest Service in 1925. The former Lava Cast Forest Geological Area was established by the Forest Service in 1942 and is now a part of Newberry National Volcanic Monument. The name of the area is based on the many lava trees and tree molds in the area, but the name is incorrect because a mold is formed around an object whereas a cast fills a mold. So actually the name should be "Lava Mold Forest".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://imgcdn.geocaching.com/cache/386927ad-feb4-4519-b014-39a5d41cf4dc.jpg?rnd=0.5632402" alt="Tree mold forming in Hawaii" width="100" height="141" hspace="5" border="0" align="left" /&gt;Lava&lt;img src="http://imgcdn.geocaching.com/cache/6b79dd6d-622a-4c0a-97a1-5c7b02210caa.jpg?rnd=0.2552345" alt="Tree mold in Hawaii" width="100" height="171" border="0" align="right" /&gt; trees and tree molds are formed when lava enters a forested area. As fluid pahoehoe lava surrounds a living tree, a crust of solidified lava forms around the tree due to the moisture in the tree causing cooling of the lava surface. The tree typically burns out to leave a vertical, open tree mold. If the level of the flow drops, a collar of lava may project above the final surface to indicate the high stand of the flow. These collars of lava are referred to as lava trees. When the tree burns through at flow level, the upper part of the tree may fall into the lava and become coated with lava to form horizontal tree molds. Horizontal tree molds also form when trees are pushed over in the high velocity deeper rivers of lava and are held in place by their roots. Vertical tree molds typically only form where flow velocity is low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon-14 age-dates for eruptions along the NW Rift Zone of Newberry Volcano range from 5800 to 6400 C-14 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon-14 age-dates must be corrected to give calendar or actual year age-dates. Primarily because the production of C-14 in the atmosphere by cosmic rays is not uniform through time, age-dates derived from C-14 must be calibrated with known dates. Conversion from C-14 to calendar years is now possible throughout the range of 0 to 11,390 calendar years ago based on tree ring chronologies and other methods allow corrections back to almost 22,000 calendar years. C-14 age-dates are always referenced to the year 1950 A.D. Calendar year age-dates are likewise referenced to 1950.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The corrected ages for eruptions along the NW Rift Zone range from 6600 to 7200 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tree molds in the basalt flows of Newberry Volcano have been a frequent source of charcoal for C-14 dating. This source of charcoal is one reason for the 600-year spread in C-14 dates. To obtain the best possible date on a flow the charcoal should be from the outermost rings of a tree, but in a large three to four-foot-diameter tree mold the remaining charcoal could easily have come from the interior of a large pine that was 400 years old, therefore the resulting C-14 date could be 400 years to old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The corrected age that is most often used for the NW Rift Zone eruptions is 7000 calendar years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the Lava Cast Forest Trail are 12 numbered posts that are described in a brochure which is usually available at the trailhead. Information from the brochure is include below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The large ponderosa pine before you is about 300 years old. Under ordinary living conditions, ponderosas can live 300-350 years. Compare size, height, and general appearance to those trees out on the flow. All trees are approximately the same age.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hot molten lava flowed through the pine forest, surrounding or covering most existing life in its path. Present plants, rooted in wind-deposited ash, demonstrate nature’s ability to revegetate the lava flow area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wild currant, rock penstemon, and Indian paintbrush are common residents of this arid climate. Visit Lava Cast Forest in early summer when the purple penstemon and red-orange paintbrush combine with the black rock to create a sight to stir the human spirit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquid pahoehoe lava poured out of a series of vents beyond the tree line. Supply exceeded drainage, and a large lake formed where you now stand. As the eruption subsided, downflow drainage occurred, decreasing the lake depth to 10-15 feet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A downed tree has lost its struggle for survival. In death as in life, it is useful as a refuge, food, and “Animal Inn” to animals, birds, and insects. The wood gradually decays and assists in making new soil which will support a future forest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tree molds were formed as lava spilled through the pine forest, flowing against the upstream side of the tree trunks. Lava Cast Forest derives its name from the concentration of these features. A more accurate explanation, however, defines a cast as having filled a mold, while a mold is formed around an object such as a tree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proof that two trees once grew together remains in the half-molds. Generally, the open side faces downhill and indicates lava flow direction. The holes extend 10 to15 feet under the lava into soil which once supported the vanished forest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three trees came from this single stump. The holes join at the base.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fissures containing a series of vents extend almost seven miles in a northwesterly direction. This line of weakness in the earth’s crust originates at East Lake in the caldera of Newberry Volcano. At this trail stop, Newberry Volcano occupies the entire skyline. Fissures should not be confused with cooling cracks clearly visible from here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When lava surged through the stands of pine, some trees were pushed over by its force. Trees that were snapped off were carried away. Others remained, anchored by their roots. Horizontal molds show this feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From this rock rim, notice an isolated forested island, or “kipuka”, surrounded by an expansive sea of lava. The island contains a cluster of much older cinder cones completely encircled by the younger lava. Your rocky perch is also a remnant of an older lava flow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During flood stage, the lava current moved a clump of trees to where you see the jumbled pattern in the mold at this site. Lava, reheated by the burning trees, dribbled into the space between the original mold and charred wood. This pattern is often mistaken for bark impressions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;center&gt;A multi stage tagged event 
&lt;center&gt;Start at : 
&lt;center&gt;N 43° 45.379 W 120° 54.908 
&lt;p&gt;As I have no Alpha stamps for this lay out, when you find the
tags, The top line will be for the North and the bottom line will
be for the West.&lt;br /&gt;
This is a small tour of Kotzman Basin and will give you time to
view the wildlife and if done at night it will give you one heck of
a light show.&lt;br /&gt;
Just to placate a local geocacher, I have included major clues
below.&lt;br /&gt;
The final cache is a small, round tin can about 6 inches deep and 4
inches across and is EXTREMELY WELL HIDDEN in the rock. You will be
traveling cinder and bare roads so be prepared for whatever you
come across. There might be some backtracking involved, there might
be some closed roads and there will be some hiking. Take your kids
and dogs on this one and plenty of water and food for all of you.
Heck, you might even find some lava bombs. While out and about, I
saw Elk, Deer, and Pronghorn as well as numerous birds of all
types.&lt;/p&gt;

We took the long way from there, but neither one of us minded.  Kyle got to practice his driving...and I got to sit in the passenger seat and really take in the scenery.  We saw a few deer, but that's about it.  No sheds.  TNBM

one, here it is. Read this description first before really heading
out.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">There is a good camping spot at Cabin Lakes Guard Station and
campground. It is a dry camp so bring water but there are
outhouses, tables and fire rings here. This would make a good base
camp for the several caches in the area. And more to come. This
cache is 10.17 road miles from this campground and would make a
nice mountain bike ride as the cache is over fairly good dirt back
roads. If you so choose and want to try to drive into this cache,
well, good luck. YOU WILL NEED HIGH CLEARANCE FOUR WHEEL DRIVE!!!
No way around it. Cheap paint job would be nice also. This would
make a nice hike from several different starting points. Take extra
fuel, tires, food, water, gear and anything else you might think
about. And, let others know where you are heading and when you
should be back. If you do get into the Garden, You will find old
homesteads but please do not disturb. Bring your cameras and optics
and expect the unexpected. Also, camping and hiking in the Garden
would make a nice weekend outing. On to the cache. This is a
replanted ammo can . This cache container used to be the “Above The
Garden” Cache in Fort Rock State Park. I was asked to remove it by
the Parks people so I just recycled it to here. This is a WELL
HIDDEN ammo can with lots of goodies in it, but the location is
what you really are after. Take lots of water to drink in the
summer months and plenty of heating devices in the winter.

Had looked at the topo's and planned a route in with the hopes that the geomobile had enough clearance to drive within about .3 miles. However, took the mountain bikes along just in case. After getting up the first shelf on the lava road and reaching another one to take one, walked to the end to check it out and discovered that I didn't want to take the chance of not being able to get down.

Took the bikes out and walked them to the drop off and got down. After riding a little over two miles in the soft sand of the road, ditched that idea and decided to hike the balance. Got a good cardio on the hike up, but what a great view. We were the first finders in over 20 months and the cache is till in great shape. Have added it to our favorites. TFTH. TNL"[b][pink]Dubble Bubble[/b][/pink]"SL

We did run into a couple that were camping in the Devil's Garden area, but his vehicle had about 8-10" more clearance than our geomobile. Definetely need a high clearance vehicle for the trip down off the lava road and back up again.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well, we were heading back to camp and decided to do a quick Logscaler and Red cache to finish off the day. Short drive to the cache, through half the county and a minor lava field. Roads in great shape for a tractor, earth moving equipement or a mountain goat. Arrived at the cache site near dusk and made the short hike(Ha Ha) to cache for the find. Enjoyed what view we had and off we went back to the truck. (About 30 minutes to the cache and 5 minutes from the cache back to the truck) Headed home in the dark, as usual for us, and enjoyed an alternate route to camp, which was interesting. Had a good time finding this cache and getting to it.
Took stuff, left stuff.

We worked as a team and got more gas before things got too hairy. Only one of us took the hike to the cache and after we logged TNLN in the book, we ended up taking a golf ball and left some TP. (ya never know).
Thanks for the fun, we had a terrific day all in all. We were so in awe of our surroundings that we forgot to take pictures.

The gate to the campground is closed in the winter. In the summer you can pay to camp. Road side parking is available. The parking area is a little used side-road.

It's easy to overtighten the lid on the container. Please make sure you can open it , before you leave it. Thanks.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">We once camped here during a weekend when all the upper spots in the Crater were full. It wasn't a bad place at all for a non-premium campground. The dog had room to run and the creek was peacefull. This is the starting point of the prairie that stretches back  to the highway.

You'll be looking for three waypoints that lead you to the cache site.

 Remember the conainer lid and I wish you, a pleasant walk.

The log was wet, illegible and moldy.  I don't know why this one would have such a moisture problem, but it apparently does.  I replaced it with a new log and brought the old one in to dry out if you guys want it back for sentimental reasons.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This Earthcache will take you to a dry maar, a low-relief, broad volcanic crater formed by shallow explosive eruptions. Because of the nature of the volcanic explosion, a maar will frequently be filled with water, such as Battleground Lake, in WA state.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Hole-in-the-Ground did not fill with water after its forming event, thousands of years ago. The volcanic mountain rose at the edge of a huge, pluvial (rain-formed) lake that covered most of the Ft. Rock Basin.  

The hot, rising magma turned the ground water into explosive steam, which then blew the top of the mountain into the air. Scientists believe that there were 4 significant explosions during this formation period, which blew rocks up to 8 meters (26’) in size close to 4 miles away. There are numerous large, volcanic rocks that have rolled back into the crater, and scattered about the landscape outside of the crater as well.

 “The crater was formed in a few days or weeks by a series of explosions that were triggered when basaltic magma rose along a northwest-trending fissure, or diatreme, and came into contact with abundant ground water at a depth of 300 to 500 m  (984’-1640’) below the surface. After the initial explosion, repeated slumping and subsidence along a ring-fault led to intermittent closures of the vent, changes in the supply of ground water, and repeated accumulations of pressure in the pipe.” Heiken, Fisher &amp; Peterson.

The crater is now 367’ to 840’ below the original ground level, which fulfils the requirement to be classified as a maar---the crater floor is lower than original surface.

PLEASE NOTE:
While this location, and the roads leading to it, are on National Forest property, some of the property that surrounds the access roads is private property, and the Forest Service personnel request that, on your drive to this cache, you stay on the posted forest service roadways.


The coordinates will bring you to the western rim of the crater of Hole-in-the-Ground. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, will require you to accomplish these tasks in order to claim the cache:

1.	At the posted coordinates, note your elevation on your GPSr. Take a careful drive around the rim track, stopping at the eastern rim. There is room for parking off the track. Make your way to the highest spot (in your determination) and again make note of the elevation.
Email us the difference in elevation between the east and west rims. DO NOT post this in your on-line log. Your post will be deleted.
2.	At your stop on the eastern rim, find some of the pebble-sized volcanic rocks.
Email us the color of these pebbles. (ditto the logging note above)
3.	Post a photo that shows your caching party, your GPSr, and the crater.

IMPORTANT: The rim track is just over 3 miles long. The track is well-worn, but has assorted rocks that add to the bumpiness of the ride. A low-slung vehicle could find the way too challenging, but any other vehicle should find it passable. Two-wheeled or pedestrian transportation will also work well.</groundspeak:long_description>

(I recommend their Binocular Tour, if they offer it that session. The Coathanger is now my favorite asterism. Ooo, new word!)

I found my way over the fence and moseyed on over to GZ. Coords were good, for which I am thankful, considering there are no real landmarks around it that I can remember. I nearly tripped over the thing, but at least I can say I found it. Subsequent finds this long weekend will prove that this area holds the largest concentration of ammo cans that I have seen in years. How about that: I've been caching for only 5.5 years, and already I'm waxing nostalgic. What a weekend. TNLS</groundspeak:text>

When you are not star gazing or caching, watch a movie in the tent at the observatory.
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;A climb to the top of the rocky spine on Pine Mountain's southeast ridge. On-trail and off to the base, followed by a scramble up the loose rocks. Enjoy the views but be careful and do not attempt alone. When the cache was placed, 5 turkey vultures circled overhead--and sometimes below--with interest. There are several other caches along the undulating ridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Godzilla&lt;/i&gt; is a landmark 1954 Japanese sci-fi monster film about a giant sea creature mutated by nuclear radiation who ravages Japan. &lt;i&gt;Gojira&lt;/i&gt;, as it was called in Japan, was a combination of words for gorilla and whale. The monster, part dinosaur and part dragon, was played by a stuntman in a heavy suit who stomped through model cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years later, an American version, called &lt;i&gt;Godzilla, King of the Monsters!&lt;/i&gt;, added scenes with Raymond Burr to the original footage. Burr played an English-speaking reporter covering the monster. This avoided too much dubbing for the American audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film had a strong anti-nuclear message. Key scenes reflected events from nuclear testing and from WWII, and the monster itself represented the fear of uncontrolled nuclear weapons. Godzilla is one of the greatest fictional characters in film history and has become a pop culture icon. It is one of the few fictional characters to win the MTV Lifetime Achievement Award and has its own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. There have been many spin-offs to the original which created an entire subset of monster film.&lt;/p&gt;

We dropped our packs and climbed over the ridge along the final saddle and worked our way up enjoying the views and cool groves of Mt Mahogany.  The winds were very gusty making camping in the saddle the better option to an open one on the ridge line. The cache is safe and sound albeit a bit lonely since it has been almost 2 years since the last find.  Now back to camp for a nice dinner. TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">  This cache is a 3-mile hike from the Pine Mountain campground. It is pretty much a loop so the final leg will put you back in the "vicinity" of your starting point.  The stages are etched onto rectangular metal tags attached to trees. There are 4 stages with stage 3 giving the coordinates to the cache. The overall terrain traversed will take you about 750 feet in elevation gain/loss.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False"> Wear good hiking boots and carry water. At a leisurely pace with time to look for the tags and enjoy the views your travel time will be about 2 1/2 to 3 hours. You will be visiting some very scenic vistas so bring the camera! Enjoy!

The 400 ft. drop and 600 ft climb on the third leg was rough on me.  I'm well into my sixtys and over 100 lbs overweight.

I started at point 10 on the Lava Cast Forest walk completing the trail and then down the road to this intersection. After this cache I went up through the old quarry to find a cache then back past this one and down to the boundary. From the boundary I went back past my car and into the Lava Cast Forest again. In total, I clocked 3.28 miles (5+ KM) in 1:38 including the time I was signing logs.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/ed95eac0-f167-46a5-8b81-bc39cea13241.jpg" align="right" /&gt; &lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Name.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Mars was the Roman war god, and his shield and spear form the planet's symbol (also used to designate the male gender and iron). The word martial comes from Mars. He was also a god of agriculture before becoming associated with war. In many cultures Mars represents masculinity, youth and conflict. Science fiction draws heavily on Mars as a source of other life and as a colony of Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Romans were known as a warlike people and Mars became their patron god. They built temples for him and honored him with many celebrations during the year. One of the most famous parts of Rome was called the Field of Mars (Campus Martius), and it was here that the army gathered with their spoils after a successful campaign. The month of March, when spring campaigns usually began, was dedicated to Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/6cea192f-2933-4aaa-bf3d-cabf6a532f78.jpg" align="left" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Factoids.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Mars' blood red color is primarily due to iron oxide dust that blows during frequent dust storms from its surface into the thin atmosphere. The rocky surface contains huge impact craters, the largest (dead) volcano in the Solar System and the deepest canyon. Some water exists, especially in polar ice caps, and may actually flow in protected places during the warmest times. Ground features suggest that much liquid water once existed, and the south polar ice cap still contains enough water to cover the planet, although the thin atmosphere cannot hold water on the surface for long. There are two tiny satellites, Deimos and Phobos (fear and terror) thought to be captured asteroids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distance from Sun = 1.5 AU (140 million miles)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diameter = 0.53 Earths (4220 miles)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Length of year in Earth years = 1.9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Satellites = 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mean surface temperature = 210 K (-82 F)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weight of 100 pounds on surface = 38&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Exploration.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Mars can easily be seen from Earth with the naked eye. It has been mapped and explored by several orbiting spacecraft and surface landers, and more are planned. Some of the experiments have been aimed at determining if life does or once existed on Mars, although nothing definitive has been discovered. The Mars Science Laboratory (aka Curiosity) is a large rover en route to the planet for an August 2012 landing; it has more sophisticated instruments than past missions, including some to determine past life signs. Space agencies have set a goal to land people on Mars by around 2035.&lt;/p&gt;

I wonder how a lot of GC are so rarely found around here !!!

In my old Europe :) GC are found very often and it is a kind of race to be FTF ;-D
Even in deep forests or difficult to reach places...

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of caches located at USFS mineral resource pits, within the Deschutes National Forest. These pits are listed and named in the Bend District Materials Sources Land Management Plan as a mineral resource. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tribute to building our forest road system, these quarries remain as a historic reminder of a time gone by. While some are still in production, many of these are located in very scenic spots throughout forest, but are not currently maintained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intent of this series is to find the “lost quarries” that have been abandoned, and are in the process of being reclaimed by mother nature. A short hike will be required thru the quarries to find the caches.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We suggest parking at the end of the road and going for a walk!  Driving into these areas may result in damage to the area and/or your rig. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With over 160 official quarries and pits, located in remote locations throughout the forest, look for future lost quarry caches to come!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy caching.&lt;/p&gt;

Let me know what you think.  Check out the other attraction here later on at night.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is a nice little stroll around that knob of ground South of Millican,  Pine Mountain. 

As your heading along the Highway 20 trying to locate the starting spot, you will be able to look up and see where your heading too.  

If you hunted the “Where’s Red” cache, you will know what your looking for as waypoints.     If not, your looking for cat food cans with letters in  them. 

There are 12 stops, including the first stop and the cache itself.  This cache hunt is right at 15.0 miles as the crow flies and the waypoints are roughly level. Really roughly as you will see.  Plan on being able to spend a lot of time out hiking and some time sitting as you will be driving some. Somewhere around eight hours should be enough.  Remember the campground that you see. In case you need it.

There are some rough spots and it would be best to have a high clearance rig, but not needed as you will be able to hike or ride your bike over the rough sections of road, if you follow the road.  Bushwhacking is perfectly acceptable.
You can get to the start on good roads and most of the waypoints are reasonably close to a track of some sort.

To get this cache started,  Head for the  coordinates posted at the head of the page.  There is a nice little campground just before you get to the starting point.

There is a parking spot right near the starting point and one of the great views you will be seeing.  If you look close enough and the air is clean enough, you will be able to see Fort Rock to the East of East Butte, Hager Mt. at Silver Lake and maybe even the North end of Winter Rim.  The starting point is a set of stairs over the fence.  If you cross over the fence and head for the rock outcropping, you will be able to see a few points of interest. 
Remember them as you will be seeing them again. From really close up.  

Now you need to head for the stairs.  Your first waypoint is at:  216 feet at 300 degrees, magnetic, from those stairs,  behind the "Old growth.”

All the waypoints are projections from one to the next.
 
In fact, I will give all the waypoints to you right here and now as well as a hint for each waypoint.
Nice guy that I am. 

               Waypoints with hints

Print this section out as you will need it in the brush.
All you will find in the brush are the cans.

From L1, Project a course of 177 degrees’ magnetic for 0.9 Miles. 
Hint for next point: An old root wad with green Pine Tree in front. SE side.

From O, Project a course of 47 degrees’ magnetic for 3.20 Miles. 
Hint for next point: Juniper tree, you’ll be really hip here. Underneath a limb.

From G, Project a course of 14 degrees’ magnetic for 1.10 Miles. 
Hint for next point: Double butted Pine tree.  Several in the area.

From S, Project a course of 273 degrees’ magnetic for 2.50 Miles. 
Hint for next point: Large Pine Tree above old skid road.

From C, Project a course of 94  degrees’ magnetic for 1.40 Miles. 
Hint for next point: A Large Pine Tree crowded against a boulder. East side.

From A, Project a course of 139 degrees’ magnetic for 0.83 Miles.
Hint for next point: Split Boulder below Rim East Side.

From L2, Project a course of 237 degrees’ magnetic for 1.40 Miles. 
Hint for next point: 9” DBH Pine Tree in a stand of yellow bellies. North side.

From E, Project a course of 309 degrees’ magnetic for 0.70 Miles. 
Hint for next point: Small Pine Tree with 20” DBH Pine below rock knob, North side and your first “L” can, not marked with a “2”.

From R, Project a course of 62 degrees’ magnetic for 0.90 Miles.  
Hint for next point: Curl Leaf Mt. Mahogany on a point. SE side.

From &amp;, Project a course of  303 degrees’ magnetic for 1.0 Miles. 
Hint for next point: A Pine tree clump below rimrock. North side.

And for the hint for the cache itself, look for the school marm (forked) Pine Tree.  Somewhere right close you will find an ammo can. 

These numbers are as close as possible with the equipment that I have to work with.  I hope.  We will see I guess.

WOW!  Is that simple or what? Not really it seems. I have tweaked it too many times.

You should know me better then that by now I would hope.  The waypoints are not in this order,  as the last ones were.  Random selection.  Whatever I pulled from the backpack was the way I put them out.  

An example of a possible order is: L1 leads to O leads to R leads to &amp; and so on and so forth.

That should keep you busy plotting out all the possible solutions.  And some of the waypoints are disguised really well, some not. 

You will need the above information with you out in the brush.  All you will find out there are the cans.

The first finder will get a gift certificate of some sort to the Pine Tavern Restaurant - www.pinetavern.com. 
Just send me the cords for the cache.

I guess at this point I should say that I saw lots of deer but also a lot of Cougar track's while I was placing the waypoints. I also found some old kills and a possible den spot so be careful and watch your backs.

Enjoy your tour of Pine Mountain.

Got to talk with some fellers taking off in their hang gliders but we decided we like our feet on the ground.  Got some nice pictures along with a fairly strenuous hike to the cache.  The cache is in great shape and the projections worked out fine.  A little windy so did the return trip to the car via the east side of the mountain.  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Armed with a full magazine of information from the CO, I headed out yesterday morning with renewed enthusiasm.  I became intimate with the mountain...the sights, the sounds and the smells.  I know now that the only way to truly appreciate the smells of the local plants is to plant your face right into them as you are rolling down the hill.  I also now know the difference between true north and magnetic north...and not to go THAT way.

The conditions were better than they were last week but the snow still gave me problems here and there.  I saw many beautiful sunrises and sunsets along the way and was treated to a spectacular moon rise last night shortly before I had to call it a day.  I went back and completed my adventure today.  Thanks for the tour Logscaler and Red.  

All of the waypoints are in place.  Maintenance check complete...all is well.

Four days, thirty two hours...one survivor!

I did have a fantastic morning though.  I got up there before sunrise and cooked a little breakfast over a campfire.  The sun came up and it was spectacular.  I was hopeful and energetic...now I'm tired and sore, and trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong.  All that time on the least coast must have dumbed me up or something.  It's not just that I can't find the clues, but I question whether or not I'm even in the right zip code.  It may be time to start over.

If you see my tracks out there, don't follow them.  You do not want to go where I have been!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Another spot that we have known about for a long time and waited for someone else to place a cache at.  After several years of no takers, we where driving past and decided what the heck, lets place the cache.

This is the site of the old Big Hole Butte Lookout tower.  The pilings are still there as well as a few scraps out through the shrubs but not much else.

The hike into here is around a half mile and 400 feet elevation gain. The road into here is kinda hard to find and is not for you town car or even low clearance SUV type rides as the road is washed out in places and the trees roots make some hellish speed bumps. Bottom out your shocks type bumps.  The Shrubbrush pinstripping will be easy to get and the windfalls make the route narrow..

Your looking for a camouflaged Gatorade mix canister semi hidden.   

Check out the Big Hole while in the area as well as Hole in the Ground and Fort Rock, all visible from this location.</groundspeak:long_description>

In any case, our relationship to the planet developed long before we understood what it really was. As the earth mother, her symbol is the Greek sign for &lt;i&gt;sphaira&lt;/i&gt;, sphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Factoids.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Earth and its satellite, the Moon, occupy a sweet spot around the Sun where temperatures never get too high nor too low to support varied forms of life. If her orbit changed and carried her closer to the Sun, she would roast and life as it now exists would be destroyed. Swinging too far away from the Sun, she would freeze into a ball of ice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her magnetic field shields life against deadly, electrically charged particles that stream outward from the Sun, as well as create beautiful aurora displays. In the Solar System, only Pluto, with its companion Charon, has a satellite so close to its own size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distance from Sun = 1 AU = 93 million miles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diameter = 7918 miles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Satellites = 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mean surface temperature = 287 K (57 F)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Name.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; The goddess of the Moon was called Luna and Diana by the Romans, Selene and Artemis by the Greeks, and many other names in other mythologies. She represents hunting, healing, childbirth and seasons among other things. Insanity or lunacy is often attributed to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/d5b5c24c-d1b1-45bd-bef7-d43f64c3e28b.jpg" align="left" /&gt; &lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Factoids.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; The July Full Moon (July 3, 2012) is called the Full Buck Moon because July is normally the month when the new antlers of buck deer appear. It is also known as the Full Thunder Moon for summer thunderstorms, as well as the Mead Moon and Full Hay Moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Moon is a quarter the size of Earth and the pair are considered a double planet. In the Solar System, only Pluto with its companion Charon has a satellite so close to its own size. Besides its enormous influence on Earth, the Moon is the only other body in the Solar System we have personally visited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distance from Earth = 239,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diameter = 0.27 Earths (2,160 miles)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mean surface temperature = 130-220 K (-225 to -63 F)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extreme surface temperature = 70-390 K (-333 to 242 F)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weight of 100 pounds on surface = 17&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">The more I cache, the more I learn to stay pretty much away from micros. They generally take too much time and too much work for too little payoff, in my book. I mean, I can understand that perseverance is a virtue and part of a complete work ethic, but if I'm going to spend significant leisure time looking for a needle in a haystack, then that needle had better be made of pure gold. They rarely are, of course, which is also why I don't bother with lotteries. You can't waste your time and money if you don't play.

There are times like this, however, when I'm headed somewhere else in the only safe direction, and I find myself practically tripping over the darn thing (literally, with all these rocks here!), in which case I can temper my ostensible disdain with merely seething resignation. And one cannot really shake a stick at a rest break from the uphill trek after having found On the Way to Littlerock (GC3PJPP) on the way to Littlerock (GC2B2).

As it happens, I found this one with relative ease. There are a few small items in this cache, which technically makes this a small, not a micro. I was even able to add to its collection. Thanks for the cache, but if you will excuse me, I'll be on my way, for I am after bigger fish today.</groundspeak:text>

Let me know how you like it? To snag this log for a Smilie you will need to bring a liter of water or so and grab fast!!  &lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;No tools needed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt; except a writing stick. Cache is in the woods not far from another of our caches, no mosquito's but maybe some dust?  Easy parking, don't get wet......Enjoy....&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moderate hike on faint, rocky trail along Pine Mountain's northwest ridge on the way to &lt;a href="http://coord.info/GC2B2"&gt;Littlerock&lt;/a&gt;. You can start from the campground or drive a little closer. Part of the classic sci-fi cache series on Pine Mountain for the annual Geo-Star Party. When you are not star gazing or caching, watch a movie in the tent at the observatory.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Man from Planet X&lt;/i&gt; is a low budget, moody sci-fi tale of an alien encounter, similar to but not nearly as well received as &lt;i&gt;The Day the Earth Stood Still&lt;/i&gt;. It is set in the Scottish moors near an observatory. A strange looking humanoid lands the same time a rogue planet is discovered approaching Earth. The alien communicates with modulated musical sounds, a concept used three decades later in Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The plot's fear, selfishness, cruelty, abductions, and revenge inevitably lead to a sorry end which mirrored cold war themes of the 50s. Other movies from this period included &lt;i&gt;Invaders from Mars, War of the Worlds,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Thing from Another World.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Factoids: The movie was produced quickly on sets from the 1948 &lt;i&gt;Joan of Arc&lt;/i&gt;, using fog to change mood and location. The lead actor, Robert Clarke, specialized in early sci-fi movies and later bit appearances in many well known TV episodes. He was paid $350 per week in 1951. The alien was played by an unknown actor who was said to have complained about his uncomfortable costume and low pay.&lt;/p&gt;

Really enjoyed the early morning drive and hike through the mountains. Saw a herd of deer with a couple of bucks tagging along as well as many wild flowers in bloom, particularly the Lupine and Indian Paintbrush. Hiked a loop of about 1.8 miles from the end of the road to the north to get the two caches on the ridgeline. TFTH. TNLNSL

&lt;p&gt;Embark on a grand tour of the Solar System, visting each of the planets and the Moon. The tour will take you to the far reaches of Pine Mountain in roughly scale distance from the Sun (campground fire ring)--compressed into 3 miles! At each stop, note the number code which you will need to find the final cache location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Placed for the 10th Annual Pine Mountain Geo-Star Party.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/301d0b8b-1346-4a40-bdee-167cc9694081.jpg" align="center" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Hunt.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; The caches for the inner planets of Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, as well as our Moon, are close to the campground. The caches for the outer planets of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto are farther away. Plan your route carefully if you want to visit them all! See the Grand Tour Bookmark List at right for the 10 caches which include a night cache, a multi-cache and a linked (bonus) cache. The back of the event coin displays their symbols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At each planet and the moon there is a number code. Arrange the 10 planetary bodies in order of their distance from the sun (closest first, Moon follows Earth) to obtain the coordinates for the Sun's cache: N 43 &lt;b&gt;ab.cde&lt;/b&gt;, W 120 &lt;b&gt;fg.hij&lt;/b&gt; where &lt;b&gt;abcdefghij&lt;/b&gt; are the numbers arranged in proper order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a large, camo cylinder, courtesy of Putter&amp;amp;Sassy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Background.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; The idea of a planetary Grand Tour was developed in the 1960s to take advantage of a unique alignment of the planets that would not reoccur for 176 years. The gravitational attraction of the large outer planets could be used to "sling shot" spacecraft to the next planet. Budget cuts to the space program doomed this ambitious project, but a modest version was incorporated into the successful Voyager program launched in 1997. After flybys of the four large outer planets and some of their moons, Voyagers 1 and 2 continue to provide data nearly 35 years later as they leave the Solar System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Solar System.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; The Solar System comprises the Sun, 8 primary planets and their moons, several dwarf planets including Pluto, and many other smaller objects. The planets are spread out over a disk diameter of roughly 7.5 billion miles. For reference, Voyager 1 is now over 11 billion miles from the Sun and on its way to entering interstellar space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/f59db54c-bca4-4835-80d9-18b0c2e97aa1.jpg" align="center" /&gt; &lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/c633c3fa-cc8b-4d45-8091-6713c96f931c.jpg" align="right" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sun.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; The Sun provides nearly all the Solar System's energy and mass (the planets and moons contribute only a fraction of a percent). It is a small, young, bright star classified as a yellow dwarf and is 109 times the diameter of the Earth. Because we are so close to the Sun, it is by far the brightest object in the sky and is regarded as a deity in many cultures. Small changes in its energy output have dramatic effects on Earth. We are slowly learning about its construction, characteristics and origin. We think that in roughly 5 billion years it will use up its fuel (hydrogen and helium) and expand into a red giant which will engulf the Earth. The Sun will then eject its outer layers and become a tiny, faint white dwarf.&lt;/p&gt;

We took pine mtn. road to FRD 400 that put us within .16 of the cache straight uphill.  It wasn't too bad but it is steep. It seemed like miles got to the little rock but had to climb on top to see the spectacular views.

I found the cache more quickly than I expected (rocks &amp; myself just don't get along), but I enjoyed the view and brought out a couple trackables for a documented visit on the horns of an accommodating animal skull, which was both artistic and disturbing. Nice view out of here, though. This was a good morning hike, but I'm ready to head back now. TNLS</groundspeak:text>

Made the 7.5 mile drive, each way, over the washboard road and arrived about 3:30 PM to discover it would be at least a mile hike out and another mile back, 94* temperature and we decided to come back early this AM for the hike. No noticeable trail until about .25 mi to go. At least there were no thorns to work around, just rocks and sagebrush. First sited the little rock at about .18 to go. Finally got the full view at about 500' to go. Wow what a rock!! Thankfully there was an easy route to GZ. Found signed and snapped many photos on this beautiful day just before noon with a bright sun. Surely worth the effort.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;One of 11 caches--and the only night cache--in a series based on the Solar System. Reflector course starts at the west end of the campground and ends in roughly a quarter mile. Placed for the 10th Annual Pine Mountain Geo-Star Party. &lt;b&gt;Note the Bonus Code on the log sheet to complete the &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://coord.info/GC3NF54"&gt;Grand Tour&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Hunt.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; This is a night-only hunt that starts at markers on a tree at the posted coordinates. There are about a dozen more points with tacks leading you to the cache. A modest flashlight will work fine, you don't need a searchlight. If the markers blink at you, do not approach them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terrain is off-trail and mostly level, but watch your step because recent logging has made the ground uneven in places and left large slash piles. The final cache location should stand out. The container is a plastic lock &amp;amp; lock style that can hold small travelers. After the cache you can either retrace your steps or head east to catch the road for the short walk back to camp.&lt;/p&gt;

Mercury is the son of Jupiter and Maia, one of the Pleiades, and is comparable to the Greek god Hermes. Both Mercury and Hermes were messengers of the gods, and also attended to commerce, trade and escorted the souls of the departed to Hades. Mercury is the source of words such as market, merchandise, merchant and merciful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/15f96f35-a52f-41be-8cc8-7dec3e37e48d.png" align="left" /&gt; &lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Factoids.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Mercury is the smallest of the 8 major planets, smaller than even a couple of moons. It is the closest planet to the Sun and the fastest at over 100,000 mph. Its surface looks similar to the Moon, with extensive plains and heavy cratering, indicating that it has been geologically inactive for billions of years. Distinctive, narrow ridges extend up to several hundred kilometers; these may have been formed as Mercury’s iron-rich core and mantle cooled and contracted after the crust had already solidified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercury is usually visible only during morning or evening twilight. During the day it is too close to the Sun to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distance from Sun = 0.31-0.47 AU (29-44 million miles)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diameter = 0.38 Earths (3,032 miles)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Length of year in Earth days = 88&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Satellites = 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mean surface temperature = 200-340 K (-100 F to 152 F)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weight of 100 pounds on surface = 38&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Exploration.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Two spacecraft have studied Mercury and another is planned. Mariner 10 mapped 45 percent of the planet in 1974-5 after a flyby of Venus. Decades later, MESSENGER also visited Venus before reaching Mercury in 2008 where it mapped the remainder of the planet. It eventually went into orbit and is in an extended mission mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A European-Japanese spacecraft with two probes is planned to be launched in 2015 and to reach Mercury in 2019, although current financial problems could delay the project.&lt;/p&gt;

Special K was up about 7 AM the next day and decided he'd walk down to the last marker that we'd found the night before and see what he could find.  It took some time wandering around, but he finally tracked down another marker about 95 steps away from the last one.  Once there, it was a quick hop to the next reflector and then a brief search led to the final location which was still in excellent shape.  First find since 2013... very nice.

Came back the next afternoon with a helpful hint on which direction to go, and was able to spot the next reflector in the daytime once I'd headed a ways in the right direction. Needed to head toward the thickest bit of the woods (northwest I believe). Once I'd found the reflector that eluded me the night before, finding the next couple in the daytime wasn't too difficult.

You will need to identify the Seven Sisters on the wheel as well as answer several questions about constellations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that you are at an observatory, so if you need help just ask someone, search the web on the observatory's open Wi-Fi network, or visit the observatory store if it is open.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;img src="http://imgcdn.geocaching.com/cache/large/ecf67d90-2eeb-410d-b3ab-7e7153119064.jpg" align="left" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pleiades.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; The Pleiades is a prominent star cluster in the Taurus constellation. It is relatively close to Earth and its brightest young stars, the Seven Sisters, can be seen with the naked eye. Because its movements coincide with the annual farming and navigation seasons, and its location results in frequent occultations with the Moon and planets, the Seven Sisters is central in the myth and legend of almost every culture. It was the first star group mentioned in astronomical literature around 2357 B.C. in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kiowa, a Native American tribe, tell us that seven maidens camped near a river known to have many bears. One of the bears began to chase the maidens, who climbed a rock and asked the Great Spirit to save them. The ground was raised into the sky and the bear clawed the side of the rock in vain, the marks of which are seen on what we now call Devil's Tower in Wyoming. The seven maidens remain in the sky as stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pleiadians.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; A modern legend is Nordic Aliens, also known as Space Brothers or Pleiadians, who are said to be a group of humanoid extraterrestrials that resemble Nordic Scandinavians. They are 6 to 7 feet tall with long blond hair and blue eyes. Their skin ranges from fair colored to tanned, they are in excellent physical shape, and they often wear skintight clothing. During the 1950s, many contactees, especially those in Europe, reported beings fitting this description. A group of Nordic Aliens apparently settled in Central Oregon where they can often be seen running, cycling, skiing, dominating local sporting events, and driving Volvos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nordic Aliens have been described as benevolent or even "magical" beings who want to observe and communicate with humans. Contactees have said that the Nordics are concerned about the Earth's environment and prospects for world peace, and transmit messages telepathically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Star Wheel.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; The Pine Mountain Star Wheel shows 7 prominent stars from the Pleiades cluster: Alcyone, Atlas, Celaeno, Electra, Maia, Merope and Taygeta (it omits Asterope and Pleione). The wheel turns. If you align a star so that light shows through, a letter will be revealed. Keep your eyes out for the wheel and note that no ATVs or motorcycles are allowed around the campground. Please don't divulge the wheel's location to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the latitude of the cache, &lt;b&gt;N 43° 47.XXX&lt;/b&gt;, find the "father" star and its corresponding letter. Next, name a star constellation that also begins with this letter. Hint: it was the first recognized constellation and was referenced in "The Odyssey" by Homer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, name the brightest star in this constellation. Hint: This orange giant of magnitude −0.04 is the 4th brightest star in the sky and the brightest star north of the celestial equator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To calculate the decimal minutes of the latitude, &lt;b&gt;XXX&lt;/b&gt;, multiple the number of unique letters in the name of this star by 73.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the longitude of the cache, &lt;b&gt;W 120° 55.YYY&lt;/b&gt;, find the faintest star in the Pleiades (because she married a mortal) and her corresponding letter. Next, name a star constellation that also begins with this letter and is in the Zodiac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, name the brightest star in this constellation. Hint: This orange-hued giant is the 17th brightest star with a magnitude of 1.14, it is 34 light-years from Earth and has a planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To calculate the decimal minutes of the longitude, &lt;b&gt;YYY&lt;/b&gt;, multiple the number of unique letters in the name of this star by 190.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Latitude: brightest star in constellation _______________ is _______________&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;N 43° 47.XXX where XXX = unique letters in star's name x 73 = _______&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Longitude: brightest star in constellation _______________ is _______________&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;W 120° 55.YYY where YYY = unique letters star's name x 190 = _______&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It was a nice walk for the whole family just before we headed back down the mountain.  The kidlets were happy it was a big enough cache to hold some trading items - that's their favorite part of the hobby!  Thanks for all the caches up on the mountain.</groundspeak:text>

We each contributed knowledge of Astronomy, Astrology, Mythology, and Mathematics along with some good, but wrong, guesses. Had to resort to the Googleverse to check the facts, and came up with something likely. Aha! The CO was sitting nearby and was kind enough to look at our answer. With some confidence, we headed toward the cache site. made a wrong turn and parked below, but found a trail next to the cougar scratching-post that got us close enough. Super-- a clean logsheet. Thanks for one that really took teamwork.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The cache is planted in a spectacular rock formation which is the reason for the location.  For those of you familiar with the area, you will recognize it immediately.  For those of you who have not seen it, you are really in for a moment of "awe"... bring your camera.  

The cache is an ammo can with contents designed with men in mind.  It contains mostly tools, so please bring a small tool to trade.  You will find this cache about 300' (as the crow flies) off the main forest service road #2017. We are hopeful this cache, along with the others we've recently planted, will bring some interest to this area and the other caches that have been here for quite some time.

You can get to this one with a car - no 4WD required... winter may be another story.  There is a FTF reward:

GZ was about 15' in front of the base of the rocks so spent some time looking in all the nooks and crannies at rock base ... found nothing but a couple bird nests.  Then I read some of the logs and figured that it must be a little higher, which meant some rock climbing and I had on motorcycle riding boots.  This one will have to wait until I'm here with some different boots on and that probably won't happen because I wouldn't be here without my motorcycle.  But, ya never know .....</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;I  have June 27th 2015 on the calendar for the 13th Annual Geo-Star Party here at Pine Mountain Observatory. You are welcome come up early or stay a few days after and make a long weekend of it.  Please Email me if you are coming early so we can put rigs and tents in the campground to secure it for folks showing up later.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;  This year the moon will be 3/4 full and waxing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many interesting caches to do in a 20-mile radius of PMO. And yes, for you numbers hounds there are for your caching pleasure there is a power trail just north of the mountain that will keep you busy at least for a day and this is in addition to the many caches on the mountain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other activities besides stargazing and geocaching are bird watching, Mountain Bike riding, caving, rock-hounding, and hiking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have lived in the Central Oregon area for over 45 years so just ask and I can give you information about things to do and places to go in the area so feel free to email me with questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travel to almost all of the interesting areas around here are on gravel back roads so bring full fuel tanks, spare tires, extra food, water and charged cell phones…be prepared!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Camping will be available at the Pine Mountain Campground. Camping is free and I will provide trash hauling and drinking water. Please bring containers for your water. You can fill them at my place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The campground has 4 RV (RV’s up to 30 feet max) sites; these sites are large and could be shared with 2 smaller RV’s. There is a large group area and dispersed camp areas with plenty of walk in tent camping sites. I also have some room for tent campers and RV’s around my place if we need an over flow area. If you are bringing a RV please email or call me in advance so I have an idea how much room to hold open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wheelbarrows will be available to get tent camping supplies in to the walk in areas. There are no power, water or sewer hookups and generator use is discouraged! If you must run a generator do it mid-day, not in the mornings or evenings.  Stargazing is an event that lasts in to the wee hours of the night/morning so folks sleep late the next day. For this reason the campground and observatory areas are designated quiet zones so….  . &lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No non street legal vehicles allowed in or staging out of the campground.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stargazing begins at 9pm on Friday and Saturday nights with a talk in the lecture tent and then viewing through the telescopes after the talk. Viewing goes on till at least midnight and later if the skies are good and folks are still around and interested. The program costs $5 per person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wireless Internet and power hookups will be available on my deck “Internet Café”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Potluck-BBQ-Bonfire will be at the main group campfire pit area starting around 6pm Saturday the 27th . I will bring up my Webber gas grill. If you can bring BBQ’s let me know and we will go with a bunch of smaller ones this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget your lawn chairs and camp tables if you have them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food details: ***Bring something to BBQ and drink***.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To bring to the potluck: use your real name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A-H- main dish, and I-P, side dish or salad, Q-Z bring a dessert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to do breakfast again let’s see how many look to be coming and then start a list of who will bring what. Since we will not have the large BBQ we can try having breakfast at my place on the back deck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have raffle items please bring them!&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Found it!  Against all the odds of not doing so.  The birds for #1 and #2 have flown away and they are no where to be seen.  #3 and #4, I found on the ground and used the clip on the bottom to clip them back on to the wires in the trees.  #5 was in pretty good shape, but #6 I found out a little to late, that it had also flown away, but the coords were given in the description and got it without much hassle after that. Then the work of trying to figure out were the final could be with only 4 out of the 6 numbers that I needed, but with the four numbers I did have and a little educated guessing and tenacity, I made the find.  Both caches were in good shape, but the contents... not so much.  I opened the cache for the dogs first and it smelled of old cardboard and turpentine and the people cache didn't smell, but the candies inside were turning around on each other.  The ones that were suppose to be hard were starting to soften and the ones that were suppose to be soft were starting to harden.  So, I grabbed everything out of the people cache, except the logbook, pen and a pink "Double Bubble".  Then loaded it with a bunch of stuff I had on me, so it would still be full and placed it back were it was hidden.  Then I collected the two TB's that have making this cache home for the past 2 years and 8 months, and the Dog Cache and carried it all back to the truck.  I am going to clean the Dog Cache up a bit and bring it to the 12-12-12 pizza party with me, if you would like it back.  With all the caches you hide, I bet you will be able to find a good use for it.  Thanks for the interesting cache experience.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This cache is located in an area that, for 15 days a year (deer season), is closed to motor vehicles.  Since I was out hunting, I parked at the nearest open road and walked about 1.2 miles to it.  It was a great hike, and excellent hunting area.  Unfortunately, I saw no deer, but I did find this cache.  

After I hiked back to my vehicle, and drove about 45 minutes back toward camp, I realized I left my GPS receiver laying on a rock near the cache.  AHHHHHHHH!!!   Since I hadn't seen another hunter all day, I opted to wait and go back after it the next morning (last day of season).

I hiked back in and got my toy.  Still no deer during the hike.  However, on the drive back toward camp, I filled my tag (about 2 hours before the 2012 season closed).

Soooooo, they say everything happens for a reason.  I'm thinking that being absent minded sometimes pays off.  TFTF</groundspeak:text>

When you are not star gazing or caching, watch a movie in the tent at the observatory.
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;A moderate hike along Pine Mountain's impressive southeastern wishbone-shaped ridges to the junction of the "wishbone." There is an unmaintained trail to the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Them!&lt;/i&gt; is a 1954 film about a nest of gigantic irradiated ants. Like &lt;i&gt;Godzilla&lt;/i&gt;, the film pioneered the nuclear monster movies, and it was the first "big bug" film. The well-regarded movie had a strong cast of James Whitmore, Edmund Gwenn, Joan Weldon, James Arness, Fess Parker, and a bit role by Leonard Nimoy. It was nominated for an Oscar for Special Effects and is rated as one of the best classic sci-fi films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The giant mechanical ants were operated by technicians. Much of the film was shot in and around Los Angeles. Van Morrison's band &lt;i&gt;Them&lt;/i&gt; was named after this movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;i&gt;Godzilla&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Them!&lt;/i&gt; carries a strong message about nuclear energy. It ends with the grim warning that "...the atomic genie has been let out of the bottle... When man entered the atomic age, he opened the door to a new world. What we may eventually find in that new world, nobody can predict."&lt;/p&gt;

A good winter caching destination. Originally sponsored by The Bulletin newspaper in Bend as part of an article about geocaching published on March 26, 2003. This cache was set by Jim Witty, the reporter who wrote outings for The Bulletin for about ten years, and his creation, Mapguy and Mrs. Mapguy. Jim died of a massive heart attack in winter, 2008. He left a big hole in a bunch of hearts. But he also left the Mapguy cache. A place that exemplifies the love Jim had for the high desert.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Great place!  I never got to read any of Jim's "Outings" myself, I actually hade moved here in the winter of '08, but I do remember hearing about it and reading about it in the paper right after I got here.  Though I have been lucky enough to be able to read and use "Meet Me In The Badlands". My girlfriend has got a copy of it and we have refered to it several time to find a new place to go hiking.
Thanks, Jim.  Rest well.

About 2 miles from the campground or you can drive a little closer. Part of the classic sci-fi cache series on Pine Mountain for the annual Geo-Star Party. When you are not star gazing or caching, watch a movie in the tent at the observatory.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Queen of Outer Space&lt;/i&gt; is a campy classic from 1958 staring Zsa Zsa Gabor, Eric Fleming, and Laurie Mitchell in a tale about a revolt against a cruel, masked Venusian queen. In the kitschy plot manly astronauts crash-land on Venus and discover a society of mini-skirted space-babes led by a man-hating queen. A Venusian scientist, the spectacularly costumed Zsa Zsa Gabor, leads a revolution because she longs for the love of men again. With a story by legendary writer Ben Hecht and screenplay by Twilight Zone veteran Charles Beaumont, the film is so bad it's good. Variety called it "a good-natured attempt to put some honest sex into science-fiction."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Factoids: The movie borrowed many ideas, props and costumes from other sci-fi films of the era including &lt;i&gt;Forbidden Planet, World Without End, Abbott and Costello Go to Mars, Cat-Women of the Moon,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Fire Maidens from Outer Space&lt;/i&gt;. The uniforms worn by the Queen's Guards are red, gold and blue--the same colors used by the later Star Trek television series.&lt;/p&gt;

Really enjoyed the early morning drive  and hike through the mountains. Saw a herd of deer with a couple of bucks tagging along as well as many wild flowers in bloom, particularly the Lupine and Indian Paintbrush. Hiked a loop of about 1.8 miles from the end of the road to the north to get the two caches on the ridgeline. Made this one a favorite for the hide and location. TFTH. TNLNSL

&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/a98139ee-2faf-4581-a3fe-e305fe68025e.jpg" align="right" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Name.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Venus, goddess of love and beauty, is the one female whose name was given to an important planet. Her symbol represents a hand mirror. Venus (or the Greek Aphrodite) is commonly known as the "evening star" or the "morning star" depending on which side of the sun it happens to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Factoids.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Venus is the brightest and easiest planet to see with the naked eye. It shines with a brilliant white light, so bright that it can cast faint shadows at night, and it can be seen in the day under the right conditions. Its brilliance is due to the high reflectivity (albedo) of dense sulfuric clouds which obscure the surface. Venus comes closer to the Earth than any other planet, within 26 million miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/905585d1-359d-474f-b9ef-dbc932f691b4.jpg" align="left" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venus is the brightest object in our sky, except for the Sun and Moon. People once imagined Venus as a Garden of Eden with lush vegetation, sparkling streams, and life. They called it Earth's twin because of its similar size, mass and density. In reality, it would be hard to imagine a more inhospitable place. The upper clouds of poisonous sulfuric acid swirl at speeds almost three times faster than a hurricane, and beneath the acid clouds an extremely dense carbon dioxide atmosphere exerts pressure as strong as that which exists a kilometer below the surface of the oceans on Earth. The surface may have had water at one time, but a runaway greenhouse effect pushed surface temperatures over 860°F, making Venus the hottest planet. Ongoing volcanic activity adds to the hostile environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distance from Sun = 0.72 AU (67 million miles)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diameter = 0.95 Earths (7,520 miles)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Length of year in Earth days = 243&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Satellites = 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mean surface temperature = 735 K (865 F)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weight of 100 pounds on surface = 88&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Exploration.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Venus has been the goal of many spacecraft since 1961, by Soviet, U.S., European and Japanese agencies. There have been flybys, orbiting satellites, probes and landers. Extensive, detailed radar mapping of the surface was done by the Magellan spacecraft in the early 1990s. Future missions, including manned ones, have been proposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planet's proximity has also allowed much observation from Earth. A pattern of transits across the face of the Sun by Venus was identified in the 1600s and became an important tool to determine the size of the astronomical unit and the Solar System.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Smile, you're on Pine Mountain Observatory’s web cam! 

    Logging this cache will require a cell phone, laptop or tablet. Cell coverage is not great at the location. There is open Wi-Fi available at the site. Some cell phone carriers will work here…some will not.  I will accept a photo taken from the same location and posted with the log. Get your self in the camera, wave and save the image. See directions below.  Then, post the image with your log....easy.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">How to get to the camera: Go to the posted coordinates. Look up at the window IN the dome...do you see the camera? Next go on line with your mobile device and go to http://pmo.uoregon.edu/weather/ . Scroll down the page and find and click on "Live Dome Camera" Get yourself in the shot, wave and save the picture to your device.  Locate where you downloaded the shot. Then just post your photo with your log! 
***NOTE*** There is another camera on the telephone pole up the hill from the viewing area. http://128.223.164.243/view/index.shtml  This camera is not the one...use it only if the camera in the window is not working which does happen on occasion.***  
  
You can further check out our web site for information about visits to the observatory. http://pmo.uoregon.edu/visiting/
  There is a Forest Service campground adjacent to PMO. It is primitive camping…please pack out your trash and bring water as the camp is a dry camp. There is a restroom. The campsites have picnic tables and fire rings. The campground has 4 drive in sites capable of holding travel trailers or motor homes to 30 feet and there are 10 hike in sites including a group camp that will accommodate large groups. Several caches are available in the area!
  The Pine Mountain area has many recreational opportunities hiking, bird watching, hang gliding, mountain biking, horseback riding and of course GEOCACHING!
  Winter access MAY be possible. The road is NOT maintained for passenger vehicles from November 15th through May 1st. The last 5 miles to the top can have 3-5 feet of snow depending on the year. I plow it minimally to allow for staff access with high clearance 4 wheel drive (often chained up) vehicles. DO NOT attempt winter access with low clearance vehicles and do not come up without Chains, snow shovels, charged cell phones and emergency supplies. Remember, if you travel in the back country around here in winter.... NO Shovel? NO Chains? = NO Brains! </groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Part of the classic sci-fi movie series on Pine Mountain for the annual Geo-Star Party. When you are not star gazing or caching, watch a movie in the tent at the observatory. A short walk from camp.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;img src="http://imgcdn.geocaching.com/cache/large/6f53e9d9-0e90-4cdc-a164-9c53de2dcd2e.jpg" align="right" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Killer Shrews&lt;/i&gt; is a low-budget 1959 science fiction film about the dangers of genetic experimentation. In true B-movie fashion it made several "bad movie" lists. It was featured on the TV show Mystery Science Theater 3000 where they poked fun at the setting, strong accents of the overblown acting, and the obvious dogs clumsily dressed as giant, poisonous, man-eating shrews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the movie has its occasional highs and deep lows which makes it a fun watch if you are after a little classic 50s cheesefest. Somehow they got the original lead, James Best, to return over 50 years later for &lt;i&gt;Return of the Killer Shrews&lt;/i&gt;. This time the shrews were awful CGI but in most respects the film was true to the original.&lt;/p&gt;

He determined the course of human affairs and foretold the future through the flight of birds and other signs. Lightning and thunder expressed his anger, and the planet's symbol is a stylized lightning bolt. We also get "jovial" from the word Jove, one of the forms of the name Jupiter, which means "born under the lucky planet, Jupiter, and therefore happy and healthy."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/5c4a3637-6dc1-4c92-bd19-501e5ddcf9d8.jpg" align="left" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Factoids.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Jupiter is the first of the outer, gas giant planets as we head out from the Sun. It is comprised mostly of hydrogen and helium with many trace elements. It has no clearly defined surface but rather a complex layering of clouds, liquid and other states of matter at high pressure the deeper it goes. The orange and brown coloration in the clouds we see are caused by upwelling compounds that change color when they are exposed to ultraviolet light from the Sun. The exact makeup is uncertain but may include phosphorus, sulfur and hydrocarbons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jupiter's mass is one-thousandth that of the Sun but is 2.5 times the mass of all the other planets combined. Jupiter has been called the Solar System's vacuum cleaner because its large size and gravity attract objects. It has scores of moons, one of them larger than Mercury, and even has thin rings. It is the only planet on which we have observed collisions with other objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distance from Sun = 5.2 AU (484 million miles)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diameter = 11.2 Earths (88,845 miles)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Length of year in Earth years = 11.9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Satellites = 66&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mean surface temperature = 165 K (-163 F)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weight of 100 pounds on surface = 234&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Exploration.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Jupiter has been known since ancient times. It is visible to the naked eye in the night sky and can occasionally be seen in the daytime when the sun is low. It rotates faster than any other planet which creates an equatorial bulge and dramatic features in the outer atmosphere. Prominent among these features is the Great Red Spot, a giant eye-like storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jupiter has been a destination for several missions. The Pioneer 10 flyby in 1973 was the first spacecraft sent there. Voyager 1 provided the earliest clear photos in 1979. The Ulysses, Cassini and New Horizons spacecraft have all returned valuable data on Jupiter and its moons, often while using the planet's gravity for help in getting elsewhere. An orbiter, Juno, was launched in 2011 and should arrive at Jupiter in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Here is another great Lookout cache placed to assist with “Oregon Forest Lookout Challenge"</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The Fox Butte Lookout is an 80' steel Aermotor tower, built in 1933, also had cabin living quarters. An L-4 ground house was moved to the summit from Sixteen Butte in 1948. Although the lookout is on emergency standby status, it was staffed full-time during the reconstruction of East Butte Lookout in 1995. The tower is on the National Historic Lookout Register  it is located in the Deschutes National Forest 33 miles ESE of LaPine in Lake County, Oregon Elevation 6025' 
   The last 3/4 mile up to the lookout is gated. Believe the signs when they say “locked gate” with no turnarounds. If you do drive up to the locked gate be prepared to back down a nasty side hill road for almost ½ mile.  It is much wiser to stop at the warning sign and hike up the last 1.25 miles…you have been warned!
The cache is located just below one of the buildings adjacent to the lookout.</groundspeak:long_description>

TFTC ! From a french geocacheur visiting Oregon for the very first time :)

I wonder how a lot of GC are so rarely found around here !!!

In my old Europe :) GC are found very often and it is a kind of race to be FTF ;-D
Even in deep forests or difficult to reach places...

Anyway, thanks again to all owners In the State where it all belonged !</groundspeak:text>

Had a nice hike up on a sunny but rather windy day with the temp in the mid 60's.  Started up the tower but wind was to strong for me and Beadmaker didn't want to walk back alone.  Took in the views and had lunch after picking up the cache.  Lucky for us the cache was upwind.  Thanks for putting out the LOT.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/c9cb52ad-ba48-41af-9c61-ab24311582e8.jpg" align="right" /&gt; &lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Name.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Pluto was the god of the underworld in both Roman and Greek mythology. His name meant riches or wealth. Pluto and Hades (the Greek name for the god of the underworld) are the same being, though they differ in character. While Hades is seen as violent, Pluto is venerated and seen as a positive god who welcomes souls to the afterlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Factoids.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Pluto has long been an elusive object. It was originally know as Planet X, an unseen body that subtly influenced the orbit of Neptune. Astronomer Percival Lowell (1855-1916) spent the later part of his life searching for it without success. It was finally discovered in 1930 at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona where Lowell had worked. After much debate, the 9th planet was eventually named Pluto at the suggestion of an 11-year-old schoolgirl in England. It remained a planet for 76 years until it was demoted to a "dwarf planet" to be more consistent with recent discoveries of other small, planet-like bodies in the Solar System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/2ee29a5d-44d4-4c87-ad00-3372652fb0fd.jpg" align="left" /&gt; Pluto is tiny, about half the size of Mercury, and its rocky core is covered with a thick layer of water ice and frozen methane, pitted with craters. It is so cold that only a few basic elements would not freeze. Its strange orbit is inclined to the other planets and is highly elliptical, so that at times Pluto goes inside the orbit of Neptune. In sunlight, its surface appears pinkish, indicating the presence of carbon. There are white polar caps, probably made of frozen methane. When closest to the Sun, a thin atmosphere of methane and nitrogen may boil off the surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pluto has four known moons, the largest being Charon discovered in 1978. Charon is over half Pluto's diameter and is only 12,200 miles away (20 times closer than Earth's moon). Charon and Pluto are so close that tidal force has locked their spins and orbits. They spin in opposite directions and the same sides always face each other. Seen from Pluto's surface, Charon hangs motionless in the sky, never rising nor setting. This pairing looks very much like a binary planet, although it is not officially designated as such. Charon is named for the mythological figure who ferried the dead across the River Aceron into the underworld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distance from Sun = 30-49 AU (2.7-4.6 billion miles)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diameter = 0.18 Earths (1440 miles)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Year in Earth years = 248&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Satellites = 4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mean surface temperature = 44 K (-380 F)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weight of 100 pounds on surface = 7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Exploration.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; For many of us, Pluto will always be the 9th planet. We will learn more about it in 2015 when the New Horizons mission pays a visit. Ironically, when the spacecraft was launched in 2006, Pluto was still classified as a regular planet. Some ashes of Clyde Tombaugh, Pluto's discoverer, are aboard the spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Once upon a time when I was a young boy, I would go camping with my uncles who were much older than I.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"&gt;&lt;b&gt;They would gang up and tease me all the time. One time we saw a bunch of shooting stars in the clear night sky. What a sight they were. I asked them why they would do that and of coarse jumped on the opportunity for a little fun at my expense.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"&gt;&lt;b&gt;They proceeded to explain that someone a few miles away was shooting the stars from the sky. And I believed them. After that I always wanted to shoot at the stars and see if I could hit one. My mom spent a fortune on rolled caps for my little gun.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now it’s fifty years later and I just remembered this experience. My uncles failed to tell me that caps wouldn’t shoot down a star. Now I know. You need a ray gun!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This is a piece of Wrath of the Fire Chicken puzzle cache. To defeat the Fire Chicken you must arm yourself from six Geo Warrior’s Armories and enlist the aid of two Navigators. All the pieces are spread through out Central Oregon, from La Pine to Redmond to Sisters. Can you find them all?
(All long descriptions are fictional)</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The master blacksmiths of Improved Order of Red Men have created the Red Helmet.  You will need the helmet to protect your head from the fiery blows of the barbecue chicken, but of coarse, they have hidden it and will only reveal its cache to a worthy warrior. To prove your worth and find the Helmet, first you will have to find the Rock of the Improved Order of Red Men. Then you will have to find the North and West Keys to unlock the helmet from its cache. 
To find the Rock, you will need to answer these questions. (For help use the link to the Related Web Page.)

A) What was the original name of the order Improved Order of Red Men descended from?
0) Sons of Liberty
1) Iroquois Confederacy
2) Society of Red Men
3) Degree of Pocahontas

B) In what year did the IORM get its final name?
1) 1492
2) 1834
3) 1812
4) 1765

C) Legally, The Improved Order of Red Men is...
1) a patriotic fraternity chartered by Congress.
2) a non-profit organization devoted to inspiring a greater love for the United States of America and the principles of American Liberty.
3) Both 1 and 2
4) neither 1 or 2

D) What was the Boston Tea Party?
2) A costume party at the Boston Harbor.
3) A political rally for the English Royalty.
4) A protest against the English tax on tea.
5) A Revolutionary War tactic.

E) How did the Sons of Liberty disguise themselves?
5) As Mohawk Indians
6) As Cleveland Indians
7) As English Gentlemen
8) As harbormasters and seamen

F) What are the ideals of the IORM?
6) Democracy, Friendship and Pride
7) Freedom, Friendship and Charity
8) Patriotic, Pride and Freedom
9) Justice, Brotherhood and Charity

Once you have answered the questions, plug your correct answers into this cipher to be guided to the Rock.
The Rock of the Improved Order of Red Men - N 43*DA.EAB; W 121*BF.DCF

Go to this link to check your starting coordinates. (http://www.geochecker.com/index.php?code=f35982fd9cc1d724d9f5cbe5ba9abb6d&amp;action=check&amp;wp=4743324d324258&amp;name=47656f2057617272696f72732041726d6f7279209620492e4f2e20526564204d656e)

Once you are at the Rock, use the Red Men to find out where the Lady Who Holds The Key is resting. The Lady holds one half of the key needed to unlock the Red Helmet.

Lady Who Holds The Key - N 43*40.(year donated – 1490); W 121*27.(# of days past in the year + 254)

Now that you have found the Lady, you will have to coax her into revealing the hiding place of her key.
West Key - N 43*40.(first+1)(middle)(last-4); W 121*27.(year-1334)

To find the North Key you will need to find George and Joanne Herbert at the Angels Obelisk. The problem with finding the Herbert's: they are never in the same place twice. They have been blessed by the angels with a nomadic obelisk that relocates itself at dawn every morning. So, to find them you will have to go back to the Rock and search the old fashioned way. Open your eyes and your mind and let your feet walk the way. Once you are at rest with the Herberts, you will have to use their poem to decipher the code and find the hiding place for the North Key.

North Key - N 43*40.ABC; W 121*27.XYZ
A – S3L1W2, B – S1L2W5, C – S2L5W2
X – S3L4W3, Y – S1L4W2, Z - S2L4W2

Now you have the North and the West Keys. Use them together to find the final cache and unlock the Red Helmet.

Side Note...
I seem to have a lot of trouble in this area for getting good accuracy with my DeLorme PN-60 GPSr.  I rarely get better than 20' of accuracy anywhere around this graveyard and in some places I got no fix at all. So, I'd like to say sorry for some bad coord's.  I don't know why it is, normally I get really good accuracy even in sever weather, usually no worse than 10', but not here even on a calm and sunny day. I have been back to this site on four different occasions and it is always the same way.  I am a little curious as to what some of your accuracy readings are in the area.  If you could post what you get on average, it would be appreciated and what GPSr you own.
Thanks, The Capt'n

We are so impressed with the thought and work that went into this whole series.  I give this another Favorite.

But I was able to use the latitude and find the final cache without too much trouble. It was a gorgeous day, cool with a light breeze and perfect for doing a little caching.

started with bessie #6 and worked my way up also climbing a couple of buttes for 3 additional caches. mt. molly and mt. samantha were pretty easy with slopes not too bad and little brush to contend with. swampy butte i went straight up the north side which is steep and a lot of down trees plus brush. took my time so it wasn't too bad. found a more open way to come down a little to the west.

finished up the bessie part and then came down the swampy series making a big loop of things. nobody out and the temps stayed cool. been a while since i have been in some of that country.</groundspeak:text>

When you are not star gazing or caching, watch a movie in the tent at the observatory.
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Moderate hike and easy hide in a stand of lichen-covered mountain mahogany. Be sure the water-proof container seals properly. Enjoy the views on Pine Mountain's southeast ridge. There are other caches further along the rocky, undulating ridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Fly&lt;/i&gt; is a 1958 sci-fi horror film about an experiment gone terribly wrong. It stars David Hedison, Patricia Owens, Vincent Price and Herbert Marshall. The Hugo Award nominee film spawned two sequels, plus a 1986 remake and another sequel to the remake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The screenplay was based on a short story by the same name published in Playboy. It featured a matter transporter device called the disintegrator-integrator. Teleportation is a common theme in fiction, from Star Trek to Harry Potter, but The Fly was one of the first movies centered around the concept. If you choose to continue on this ridge to do the other caches, you may wish you had a transporter to return!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/c78ffb8a-8ee2-4379-aa9a-9892c134d79d.jpg" align="right" /&gt; &lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Name.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Saturn was the Roman god of fertility, harvest and time, and the father of Jupiter. He carried a sickle as his symbol. His name is used for a day of the week, Saturday. Saturn was worshiped in a major winter festival called the Saturnalia, which occurred around the time of the winter solstice and was a precursor to Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/429e2f6b-1426-4f96-944f-749342851851.jpg" align="left" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Factoids.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Saturn is the second of the outer, gas giant planets as we head out from the Sun, and it is the second largest planet. It is about a fifth smaller than Jupiter but much less dense. Saturn is composed mostly of hydrogen and is the only planet that is less dense than water. It bulges noticeably at the equator and its winds can reach speeds of over 1100 mph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturn is the most distant planet easily visible to the naked eye, and its prominent rings can be seen with a small telescope. The complex ring system is composed mostly of ice particles with rocky debris and dust, and it averages about 65 feet thick. There are scores of major moons including Titan, the second largest moon in the Solar System and the only one with a strong atmosphere and what appear to be hydrocarbon lakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distance from Sun = 9.6 AU (890 million miles)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diameter = 9.4 Earths (75,000 miles)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Length of year in Earth years = 29.5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Satellites = 200+&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mean surface temperature = 134 K (-220 F)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weight of 100 pounds on surface = 108&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Exploration.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Saturn has been of keen interest since ancient times. Galileo was first to see the rings in 1610 but mistook them for moons. Pioneer 11 was the first spacecraft to reach the planet in 1979. Several other spacecraft have visited Saturn, most recently Cassini–Huygens which went into orbit and sent a probe to Titan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Caption for photo above:&lt;/i&gt; Saturn's largest moon, Titan, dances around the giant planet in this recent image from the Cassini spacecraft. Titan's surface is concealed beneath a veil of orange "smog." Cassini's instruments can peer through the haze, however, to see lakes of liquid methane and ethane, river channels, giant sand dunes, and possible ice volcanoes. In this view, the big moon lines up with Saturn's rings, which cast dark shadows on the planet's southern hemisphere. A thin white band in the northern hemisphere is the remains of a giant storm that completely encircled the planet in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

When you are not star gazing or caching, watch a movie in the tent at the observatory.
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;An ordinary, shrunken, drive-up cache with little redeeming value other than the challenge. It is also at the turnoff to another cache, so you will get two chances to hunt it if you go this way. Please bring a writing stick and a log extraction tool (a paper clip stretched out and bent slightly at the tip works well for me). The log is small so just sign initials if you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Incredible Shrinking Man&lt;/i&gt; is a seminal 1957 film that won the first Hugo Award for best science fiction dramatic presentation. As with several other films from this early cold-war period, it deals with the fear of nuclear radiation. In this case, a man exposed to a radioactive cloud and later pesticide begins to shrink but is otherwise normal. The miniature man and his wife struggle to deal with his world where ordinary things become monsters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A comedy spinoff in 1981, &lt;i&gt;The Incredible Shrinking Woman&lt;/i&gt;, featured Lily Tomlin who was the victim of an experimental perfume. Other movies featured people growing into giants.&lt;/p&gt;

Hiked .94 miles R/T in 1:06 (thats :46 up with numerous stops and :20 down) and total accent of 562 ft. Was a cool, crisp but quiet up on top and the view was great.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">was wondering when somebody would finally stick a cache up here.  came in on the 490 road and parked near the end where it is blocked for bigger rigs.

started hiking up the ne side.  a little brush but most of it can be avoided if you keep to where the bigger pp are.  about half way up i was cussing myself for wearing too much.  once i got on top i was glad i had it all on.  cool, cloudy and a bitter wind howling.  enjoyed the view, did the business work and bailed off the same way i came up and back to the rig.  this one will be shut down for the winter soon.

my humble opinion is that coming from the south would be a big mistake.  lava to cross as well as steeper slopes and softer ground.  god bless america and traditional family values.  RED NECK WEENIE!!!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This cache area is one in which we found after doing some local research on Pioneers of the area. We hope you will learn a little about the folks who made Central Oregon what it is today. The coords may be a few degrees off due to tree cover.Very easy with or without the hint.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Seems as there is a little trouble with people accessing  this cache so I have added waypoints to get in here.

Follow the Paulina Lake road to the power lines and then turn South, follow the power line to the road turning West just before breaking out onto the flats

There is no need to get onto the Kelldano Ranch grounds, stay on the power line right of way until you get to the Cemetery grounds.

The claim for the original homestead on this cache site  was made by Denison Rease on August 30, 1909. 

In 1920 he and his wife,Elizabeth sold the homestead to T.W. Vandevert. This one acre plot is now known as REASE Cemetery.
Guy Rease, the son of Denison and Elizabeth is also buried in an unmarked grave.

The cemetery is located on the edge of the Paulina Meadow Prairie. Please stay on the top of the prairie as the prairie land itself is private property. 

The cemetery is not actively kept up, but someone has added some nice gravestone's amidst the unnamed ones of yesteryear. Imagine the hardships these people faced during the long,hard winters here. 

A good book to learn more of the area is called HISTORY &amp; THE HOMESTEADER OF THE LAPINE COUNTRY BY V. RIDGLEY.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Extreme Lonely Cache. I was afraid either the waypoint or the cache would be missing after 3 1/2 years but both are in perfect condition (so cache maintenance too, though we didn't need to do anything but say it's there). We found good places to park close to the waypoint, the final, and the bonus. What used to be a steep bar ditch is not a nice wide shoulder. Thanks for the find - our #1900. These 2 finds plus seeing the mountain goat from the viewpoint at Horse Ridge really made our day. We used Elk Jim's alternate coords for the waypoint since the posted coords were off (but didn't fit the hint either).

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The original 1951 version of &lt;i&gt;The Day the Earth Stood Still&lt;/i&gt; is a classic sci-fi film you can watch in the tent at Pine Mountain Observatory. The film's "subversive elements" drew criticism when released, but its message of peace in combination with its dark outlook on humanity struck a chord with audiences, earning it lasting acclaim. The untranslated phrase, "Klaatu barada nikto," spoken to the robot has become one of the most famous of all movie quotes. We think it means, "Oh, no, not another micro!"

&lt;p&gt;Stop at the moon for an easy pickup on the way up to the observatory. Near a turnout at a curve in the raod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the classic sci-fi cache series on Pine Mountain for the annual Geo-Star Party. When you are not star gazing or caching, watch a movie in the tent at the observatory.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Destination Moon&lt;/i&gt; was a 1950 Academy Award winning production and the first major film to deal with the challenges and dangers of space travel. A half-million dollar budget (big for the time) powered a solid production team that included renowned sci-fi author Robert A. Heinlein. The film won several awards and nominations including an Academy Award for Visual Effects. In later years the groundbreaking photography and special effects were seen a precursor to Star Wars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patriotic plot involves private industry financing, developing and launching the first spacecraft to the Moon. Several life threatening things go wrong during the ultimately successful mission. The first actual manned moon landing was nearly 20 years off. As the crew approaches the Earth at the movie's finale, the traditional "The End" title card heralds the dawn of the coming Space Age: "This is THE END...of the Beginning." Ironically, we have not returned to the moon since 1972.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://d1u1p2xjjiahg3.cloudfront.net/ba82d045-1d36-4b2b-8ca1-73b3a797c28a.jpg" align="left" width="125" height="95" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Factoid: Woody Woodpecker played a small part in the film during a presentation where he explains the scientific principles behind space travel to a group of industrialists. Producer George Pal was friends with Woody's creator Walter Lantz and included the cartoon character in all his films. Steven Spielberg paid homage to that sequence with a similar cartoon shown to the spectators at "Jurassic Park."&lt;/p&gt;

This is a piece of Wrath of the Fire Chicken puzzle cache. To defeat the Fire Chicken you must arm yourself from six Geo Warrior’s Armories and enlist the aid of two Navigators. All the pieces are spread through out Central Oregon, from La Pine to Redmond to Sisters. Can you find them all?
(All long descriptions are fictional)</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">First, to get this one started you will need to find, Sad Hill… Tread Softly, Chief Paulina has tended to these lands for many years and there are very few around who could guide you through the wilderness better than he can.  But, before he takes some greenhorn into the woods, he wants to know you at least have some basic skills.  So, to show that you have at least a little wits within you, the Chief wants you to plot a four corner route and find the middle.  If you can do so, then he will help guide you to that Fire Chicken.

 	Once you have found Sad Hill... Tread Softly, the ground is sacred to some; Find Paulina Prairie Rock and set a bearing to 64 degrees True North and travel for 115 feet and look there for the South marker with an ‘S’ on it.  Log these coordinates and set a bearing and distance in accordance to the instructions at the marker to find the next marker.  At each of the other markers, do the same.  When you have found all four markers, use the coordinates to find the center.  Word from the wise Chief, you are not finding the center of a square, but a trapezoid.  You will want pencil and paper for this one and maybe even a calculator.

North and East containers are cracked and were wet inside causing the hint paper to be wet. They are still legible but fairly fragile needing great care to open them.  I dried these out a bit before putting them back in their places. Did a quick calculation in the field for the final and could not locate the cache before my time was up. Turns out I was slightly off on my calculations searching close to GZ but not close enough. I'll have to come back for the final, but have no idea when that might be. Fun hunt.</groundspeak:text>

We easily found the four waypoints forming a trapezoid and decided to setup proximity circles at 0.17 mile radius. Not being an equal sided figure we know the circles would not intersect at the exact middle, but thought we could get close enough to find it.

We did with little trouble and now we're off to go locate the helmet down at the La Pine Cemetery.</groundspeak:text>

For each of the 4 cardinal waypoints, we setup a proximity alarm on our Garmin 62s units.  Found that 0.2 mile was a bit of an overshoot, so settled on 0.17 mile for the proximity radius.  Checked the likely area of proximity circle overlaps and quickly located the cache and Navigator.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Second in a series of multi-leg hiking caches by the Moondog3. Our hope is that you will take the time to wander through this area and enjoy the unique natural features.This cache will not require a long walk because the terrain is a little rough and it is a long drive for most folks.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.groundspeak.com/cache/13064_900.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache will have you exploring several features created by a lava flow from a volcanic vent. There is a fair amount of scrambling involved along several parts of the route. Take notice of the terrain rating and be sure to wear sturdy boots.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Remember to bring several flashlights/headlamps!!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Begin your journey by finding the coordinates to the first small metal tag listed below. This tag is a tarnished copper plate with the coordinates to the next tag stamped on it. The second tag will give you the coordinates to the actual cache location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, allow for some time to explore Derrick Cave before you leave. It is a wonderful example of a large lava tube cave. This is a large cave, so be sure to bring lots of candlepower to really enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr size="5" width="80%" align="center" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;IMPORTANT - PLEASE NOTE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Allow &lt;font color="red"&gt;1-2 HOURS&lt;/font&gt; of hiking to complete your walkabout.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mark your parking spot. Cross country travel is required.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bring a FLASHLIGHT to explore the small caves you will find along the way.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wear sturdy shoes. The terrain is mostly flat but is very rocky in some areas.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bring plenty of water, especially on hot days.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Always carry a compass and extra batteries for your GPS.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

But ... the folks down the road that you have to drive right through their living room must have gotten tired of Derrick Cave visitors driving through their living room.  The road to Derrick Cave from the south is now closed, gated and marked "No Trespassing, Private Property".  A map is posted that shows an alternate route to the cave (and this cache) that starts at downtown Fort Rock and passes through Sand Springs to get there from the north.  Well that was just too far out of the way for us today so we had to call it a DNF again.  I happen to know a shorter route that goes by Oregon's Largest Juniper Tree and will try that some day soon on my dirt bike.  I'm not giving up, just delayed again.</groundspeak:text>

Red and I went out this way to test the new transmission in the ride and found that some flake had removed the tag to start this hunt, again.

So we have moved the tag to another location that should not be removed or even found by accident.

Your looking for a copper tag stamped with the numbers for the next stage.

It was interesting trying to remember where stage 2 was after 8 years of not seeing it but with a little luck and geo-sense's working overtime, we did find the second tag.

We even checked the cache while there and everything was fine with it and ready for the next cacher to come along and sign the logbook.</groundspeak:text>

Although there was quite a bit of cloud cover, it was pretty warm so exploring the cave was nice and cool. The "skylights" were pretty awesome! We weren't brave enough to go too deep into the cave but we went deep enough to appreciate returning to the daylight...LOL We expanded our exploration over to another group of smaller caves where one of our dogs got herself nice and comfy.  We were all the way back to the parking area before realizing that she was still napping in the cave...LOL  Thanks for bringing us here [:D]</groundspeak:text>

TFTC ! From a french geocacheur visiting Oregon for the very first time :)

I wonder how a lot of GC are so rarely found around here !!!

In my old Europe :) GC are found very often and it is a kind of race to be FTF ;-D
Even in deep forests or difficult to reach places...

Anyway, thanks again to all owners In the State where it all belonged !</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/89aa439e-a742-4ee5-bdca-e1d2762bae98.jpg" align="right" /&gt; &lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Name.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Uranus was the ancient Greek deity of the Heavens, the earliest supreme god. The name means "rain" as the sky was the life-giving rainmaker. He had a tumultuous relationship with Gaia (Earth) with whom he fathered many children including Saturn. Gaia eventually made a sickle and asked her children to castrate him. Uranus is the only planet whose name is derived from Greek rather than Roman mythology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/c3e0e8b2-8409-41d4-b0a6-79eae14b67e9.jpg" align="left" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Factoids.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Uranus is the third of the outer, gas giant planets and the first planet discovered in modern times (1781). It is also the first planet to be discovered with a telescope. It is barely visible from the Earth with the naked eye, which explains why it was not known as a planet to the ancients, and why it had been observed many times with telescopes without realizing that it was not a star. The cloudy atmosphere is nearly featureless in visible light, although temporary spots have been seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uranus is the only planet that does not rotate perpendicularly to the ecliptic plane. It lies on its side where its north pole points almost directly toward the Sun for a half the year, and its south pole points toward the Sun during the other half. This strange axis tilt produces extreme seasons. We do not know why Uranus is tilted in this way. It has a much colder core than the other gas giants, and radiates very little heat into space. Along with Neptune it is referred to as an "ice giant."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uranus has 5 large moons, many small satellites and at least 9 rings. Several of the moons are denser than water showing that some type of ice is present, probably methane, ammonia or frozen water. All of the moons are dark gray in color which means they could be covered with carbon soot or graphite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distance from Sun = 18-20 AU (1.8 billion miles)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diameter = 3.9 Earths (31,000 miles)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Length of year in Earth years = 84&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Satellites = 27&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mean surface temperature = 76 K (-326 F)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weight of 100 pounds on surface = 108&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Exploration.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Until Voyager 2 (launched in 1977) made its flyby in 1986, Uranus was thought to have only 5 moons. The spacecraft discovered 10 other moons and a couple of new rings. It also studied the planet's unique weather and magnetic field before continuing on to Neptune. Follow-up visits have been proposed but none are planned.&lt;/p&gt;

Got to hot for hiking the buttes so will be back for those. Another stop along the trail, even though we were driving close to most of these. Discovered that the DNFS maps have a road into this one shown as assessable but there was no road there on their free maps. TFTH. SL</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">spent some time planning this trip so i could finish up the "bessie series". at least this time i didn't have to pedal up kelsey butte again.

started with bessie #6 and worked my way up also climbing a couple of buttes for 3 additional caches. mt. molly and mt. samantha were pretty easy with slopes not too bad and little brush to contend with. swampy butte i went straight up the north side which is steep and a lot of down trees plus brush. took my time so it wasn't too bad. found a more open way to come down a little to the west.

finished up the bessie part and then came down the swampy series making a big loop of things. nobody out and the temps stayed cool. been a while since i have been in some of that country.</groundspeak:text>

Part of the classic sci-fi cache series on Pine Mountain for the annual Geo-Star Party. Later when you are not star gazing or caching, watch your favorite movie by request in the tent at the observatory.
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;You do not need to cross the fence to reach the cache, but you may want to for the views. You can see several of the other ridges where more difficult caches await your journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Journey to the Center of the Earth&lt;/i&gt; is a 1959 film adapted from the 1864 novel by Jules Verne, the "Father of Science Fiction." It was nominated for three Academy Awards. In the story an Edinburgh professor is intrigued by a strange rock given to him by one of his students. Uncovering its secret leads him and a few hardy adventurers on a dangerous journey into the unknown. It has been called, "...a silly but fun movie with everything you'd want from a sci-fi blockbuster: heroic characters, menacing villains, monsters, big sets and special effects."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Factoids: Some underground sequences were filmed at Carlsbad Caverns National Park. Other shooting locations included Amboy Crater and Sequit Point, California, as well as Edinburgh, Scotland. The giant Dimetrodons at the center of the Earth were rhinoceros iguanas with large, glued-on appliances on their backs. The giant chameleon in Atlantis was a painted Tegu lizard.&lt;/p&gt;

Cache is a 35mm camo container.  It is right on the road - you don't even have to walk to get to this one.  Will you get wet?  Well, perhaps you will if you go for it during the rainy season.  Don't forget to do the other caches in this area "Derrick's Other Treasure" and "Walk-A-Bout II" and "She Is".  Take a look, there's several more caches within a reasonable range off the FS 23 Road on you way to this one. For that matter, if you haven't seen Derrik's Cave, add that to the list of todo's.  Elevation is 4950.  Happy caching.</groundspeak:long_description>

Power yourself up the little climb at the end to look around.


They sure went to a lot of trouble to harvest this little area of timber.

got back to the rig and just started back to the hiway when i spotted a small critter walking up the road.  turned out it was a small dog heading who knows where and who knows where he came from.  after about a half hour of coaxing (most of the time he just spent under the rig right in the middle where i couldn't reach him) he just comes out and jumps in the rig.  he got a free ride to the humane society where he will have a soft bed and something to eat rather than being coyote bait.  he did have a collar with a phone number and his name of "scrappy".  hope his owners get him back.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;I was in 4th grade when &lt;i&gt;Forbidden Planet&lt;/i&gt; was released in 1956. It made quite an impression on me and remains my favorite movie. The film's plot, characters and isolated setting have been compared to those in Shakespeare's &lt;i&gt;The Tempest&lt;/i&gt;. The film was entered into the Library of Congress National Film Registry, being deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant." It is one of the classics shown on request in the tent at Pine Mountain Observatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Factoids: &lt;i&gt;Forbidden Planet&lt;/i&gt; was a groundbreaking film including first to show humans traveling in a starship of their own creation; first set entirely on another world in interstellar space; first use of an entirely electronic musical score; first use of a robot as a leading character with a distinct personality. The monster mimics Leo the Lion, MGM's familiar roaring mascot.&lt;/p&gt;

started with bessie #6 and worked my way up also climbing a couple of buttes for 3 additional caches. mt. molly and mt. samantha were pretty easy with slopes not too bad and little brush to contend with. swampy butte i went straight up the north side which is steep and a lot of down trees plus brush. took my time so it wasn't too bad. found a more open way to come down a little to the west.

finished up the bessie part and then came down the swampy series making a big loop of things. nobody out and the temps stayed cool. been a while since i have been in some of that country.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;I was 21 when &lt;i&gt;Barbarella&lt;/i&gt; was released in 1968. I nearly changed my major. Jane Fonda saves the world and breaks the Excessive Pleasure Machine in the process. The feature film was the first to be made from a comic sic-fi hero. It is one of the classics shown by request in the tent at Pine Mountain Observatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Factoids: Raquel Welch turned down the title role and actress Virna Lisi quit and returned to Italy when she was told to play the part. Future Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour was one of the session musicians for the film's original score. The film's missing scientist, Doctor Durand Durand, inspired the name for the 80s band Duran Duran.&lt;/p&gt;

I wonder how a lot of GC are so rarely found around here !!!

In my old Europe :) GC are found very often and it is a kind of race to be FTF ;-D
Even in deep forests or difficult to reach places...

Anyway, thanks again to all owners In the State where it all belonged !</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Nice hide in a great place.  The view was mostly of a snow flurry today but could tell that there was potential for more.  We parked on the east side of the butte on a dirt road and that made for an easy hike up gentle terrain.  The booty lacks a writing stick so ... BYOP.  We discovered a metal pipe installed in the ground as a property marker and several of the trees around the marker location were tagged with "Bearing Tree" signs.  Each of the "Bearing Tree" signs had the approximate distance from that tree to the metal pipe.  It made me wonder how we ever find these caches out in the woods without any signs on the trees telling us the approximate distance from that tree to the cache.  Maybe the forest service hasn't discovered GPS yet.  Thanks for the hide, gets a fav from me!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache is about a .43 mile hike from the road and up a steep hill. The easiest way up is a burned out area on the southwest facing Long Butte. You'll need to do a little scrambling over rocks at the top. Wear good shoes, not the cheap hiking sandals that I was wearing. I thought I was going to break my fool neck.&lt;br /&gt;
There are lots of nooks and crannies and hiding places in the rocks so we tried to make it a little easier to find the cache (see hint).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Enjoy the view and be careful going down. There are nefarious twigs along the way. You know the kind I mean. You don't trip over them. They glom on to your shoe, letting your foot move just enough for your weight to shift forward. Then, bam!</groundspeak:long_description>

Not sure where the parking spot was supposed to be but we parked and had only a short stroll of around 750 feet.

The cache was a quick and easy find as the coords where spot on for us today.

Tomorrow, for you?  Maybe not so good. Not our problem.

Anyway, we signed and replaced where and as found.

This was our third stop of the day. After looking at the topo maps and google earth, decided to approach from the more open NE side as we could start much closer and the R/T hike was only about .7 miles. Also, after getting to the cache site, it appeared to be the easier approach up onto the rocks. Made this one a favorite. TFTH. TNL"DUBBLE BUBBLE[/b][/pink]"SL</groundspeak:text>

started with bessie #6 and worked my way up also climbing a couple of buttes for 3 additional caches. mt. molly and mt. samantha were pretty easy with slopes not too bad and little brush to contend with. swampy butte i went straight up the north side which is steep and a lot of down trees plus brush. took my time so it wasn't too bad. found a more open way to come down a little to the west.

finished up the bessie part and then came down the swampy series making a big loop of things. nobody out and the temps stayed cool. been a while since i have been in some of that country.</groundspeak:text>

It wasn't until he got home that he remembered that his GPS was set on NAD27 datum instead of WGS84 due to a Search and Rescue callout. Went back today with the right datum and made the finds.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This multi-stage cache is located on the north side of Newberry Volcano at an elevation of about 5,250 feet.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">For the last few years I’ve been volunteering with the U.S. Geological Survey as a field assistant to help with the mapping of Newberry Volcano.  This week I was working in the Sugarpine Butte area and one of my tasks involved a hike to the summit of the vent for the South Sugarpine flow. 

This unnamed cone is at the southeast end of a mile long fissure and is the major vent along the fissure producing the South Sugarpine flow.  Three additional vent areas occur to the northwest and combined produced the much smaller North Sugarpine flow. These flows are part of the Northwest Rift Zone eruption 7000 years ago.

The given coordinates take you to the summit where you will find a sign naming this unnamed butte. 
For the letters on the sign use the following letter equivalents: 
A=1
B=2
C=3
D=4
Etc.

N 43° 49.0XX’
XX = Multiply (Sign’s third letter equivalent) by 3 

W 121° 21.0ZZ’
ZZ = Multiply (Sign’s first letter equivalent) by 8.2

Check sum  XX+ZZ = 124

The cache is a screw cap plastic container. The name on the cache reflects the name you found at the summit, I decided to make it a multi-stage cache after I placed the container.

did the math and found the cache.  super view of the lava fields from up here.  weather was warming and little wind was present.  great hike!!!!</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Should have parked at the ATV track that heads up towards the butte, but silly us thought driving up the road farther to the east would put us on a ridge and easy walk.  Wrong!!  Two ascents and descents later, we were making our way up the steep South Sugarpine slope that was heavily eroded by dirt bikes in hill climbs.  The subsoil is beginning to erode and form trenches from the recent rains coursing down the ruts.  Located the sign and immediately understood the significance.  This is indeed a hardy sign, with plenty of nuts securing the several bolts.

Completed the math calculations and stumbled our way on over to the cache.  The lava below and narrative from the owner were both very interesting.  Rather than climb back up the hill, we contoured back to the base and made our way back to the rig, parked a half mile farther up the hill than it really needed to be.  Thanks for the geology lesson and the fun. Bailey and BC</groundspeak:text>

Small doll
Flashlight with batteries
Mini card games
Erasers
Sport pencils
Chalk
Cars
Markers 
Crayons
2 Clifford water squirters
And lots of other toys and goodies.
and of course a log book w/smiley face pens.

This place can be dusty if there's a lot of wind or a lot of people playing.

&lt;p&gt;Moderate hike and easy hide at a contorted thing. Enjoy the views to the east and rest before continuing on up the ridge to Pine Mountain. See Forbidden Planet (GC1DGB4) for parking coords. Part of the classic sci-fi cache series on Pine Mountain for the annual Geo-Star Party. When you are not star gazing or caching, watch a movie in the tent at the observatory.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Thing from Another World&lt;/i&gt; is a 1951 film based on the 1938 novella "Who Goes There?" A favorite of sci-fi movie fans, the black and white film is deemed culturally significant by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry. Its suspense, drama and terror hold up well today. A 1982 remake is also highly regarded, and a prequel will be released later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the story an Air Force crew and scientists at a remote Arctic research outpost discover a spacecraft buried in the ice. They take the frozen pilot back to their station and he accidentally thaws out. The hostile plant-based alien, played by James Arness, rampages through the station. A must see for vegetarians.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is a recycled cache container from Bad Dogs, original “12 days of Christmas” series done here in the area that I helped to remove.  I was able to piece together 3 cache containers out of the 12 placed, so I thought I would place them back out here.  What else are you going to do with an old cache box.  So, I will leave it up to the current finder to decide if the cache should stay or go.  If you think the container will last for the next cacher to come along, then let'er lie.  If you think it will no longer hold out, then please just take the whole container and let me know when you log your find and I will promptly archive the site.  I think the container should last at least another year or two, especially if no one places rocks on top of the cache box.
Out here in this part of the Badlands, Juniper trees (or any trees for that matter) are far and few between.  I don't know if it has anything to do with the fact that this area is the remains of an ancient dried up lake bed or not, but due to the lack of trees, you can really see how large this lake was before the river finally broke through in the canyon at Dry River Canyon.  If you're out here in the summertime though, this will also be one of the few respites from the sun.  Just watch out for the PIES, especially if the are fresh, hot and steamy.</groundspeak:long_description>

started with bessie #6 and worked my way up also climbing a couple of buttes for 3 additional caches. mt. molly and mt. samantha were pretty easy with slopes not too bad and little brush to contend with. swampy butte i went straight up the north side which is steep and a lot of down trees plus brush. took my time so it wasn't too bad. found a more open way to come down a little to the west.

finished up the bessie part and then came down the swampy series making a big loop of things. nobody out and the temps stayed cool. been a while since i have been in some of that country.

used kestrel ridge hint for this one.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Part of the classic sci-fi movie series on Pine Mountain for the annual Geo-Star Party. When you are not star gazing or caching, watch a movie in the tent at the observatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache and two others are on the way up to the paraport. You can drive fairly close to the cache with a high-clearance vehicle; note that the road is narrow with few places to pull over. It is also a nice hike of less than a mile from the gate near the main road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Planet of the Apes&lt;/i&gt; is a 1968 post-apocalyptic film based on a French novel. It features a strong cast including Charlton Heston, Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter. Astronauts crash land on an upside-down world where apes rule over men. "You know the saying, 'Human see, human do.'"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film ends with the revelation that they have been on a future Earth the entire time and that man caused his own downfall. The film ends as Heston delivers the famous line, "God damn you! God damn you all to hell!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film won several awards and spawned many sequels and offshoots. It was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://imgcdn.geocaching.com/cache/fdf16cb9-d3e7-4876-b0a1-9ca3a2d1c3db.png" align="left" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2001 remake got mixed reviews but was a financial success. Part of the marketing involved a series of 14 Project APE geocaches placed around the world. The only surviving cache is in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Winter Jaunts – Caves, starts with “Arches, Caves and Views, Oh My” traditional cache. The starting waypoint is under the lid.  I placed these a few days after a winter storm, so they should still be in good shape to find even if there is a few inches of snow on the ground.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Do you need a little walking time, but it's the middle of winter and you have nowhere to go.  Well, try this place here.  The snow won't be as deep, so no snowshoes are needed and, well heck, there just might not be any snow anyhow.  It tends to be a little sunnier and warmer out here in the Badlands and this little jaunt to see a few tumulus caves might just be the ticket to help burn off the extra dessert you ate at your holiday feast.  Don't worry to much about the caves, I am not sending you on a spelunking journey.  The caves are just big enough to crawl into and have some interesting formations. 
Once you find “Arches, Caves and Views, Oh My”, there are 2 waypoints and then the final.  You will have to do some walking though, 'cause I couldn't move the caves any closer together, so you'll just have to go to the caves.  It's about 2.7 miles as the crow flies for the round trip from the nearest area to park.  Which happens to be near “Arches, Caves and Views, Oh My”

Mt. Hood to Mt Pitt over top of the Pines.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Red and Checked and repaired the cache on 6-28-03 and upgraded the
container to an ammo can. The Bitterbrush and Gooseberry bush are
both gone but the cache is still there. And we thought about
renaming the cache " Next to the Sage" but did not. Just remember
that you need to read and heed any of those yellow posters put out
by the State Fish and Game for this area. This is a WELL HIDDEN
cache, under some rocks on a little ledge. NO DIGGING NEEDED!!!
Lots of rock shelfs to look on and to interfere with your locking
onto sats. This cache is about 12 miles South East of La Pine,
Oregon on Highway 31. You will have to find the right back track to
drive on but you can almost drive to it. Just be careful when
trying for this one. Nice little area to get to. Easy access, if
you do it right and a hike if wrong. Lots of rock outcropping here
and you need the right one. This cache container is an ammo can and
the title should give you a clue. When you think you are in the
right spot, take two more steps. Then, two more. Come on now, a
couple more. Please do not leave any ammo, smokes and/or candy in
here. Disclaimer: "Cut and Paste" logs will be deleted without
warning. We retain all rights to this cache. We can and will

      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>You need the West Facing Northerly rock outcropping with the two big Pines between North and South outcroppings. Look for a couple small Pine up top at one end and the cache is at the end of the shelf so watch your step.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

started with bessie #6 and worked my way up also climbing a couple of buttes for 3 additional caches. mt. molly and mt. samantha were pretty easy with slopes not too bad and little brush to contend with. swampy butte i went straight up the north side which is steep and a lot of down trees plus brush. took my time so it wasn't too bad. found a more open way to come down a little to the west.

finished up the bessie part and then came down the swampy series making a big loop of things. nobody out and the temps stayed cool. been a while since i have been in some of that country.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">The nearby benchmark was described by the Forest Service in 1932
"STATION IS SE OF BEND, ON THE NORTHERN SLOPES OF THE PAULINA
MOUNTAINS, ON THE SUMMIT OF FUZZTAIL BUTTE, AT AN ELEVATION OF 5719
FEET". This was once the site of a forest service fire lookout.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Built in 1933, this site once housed an L4 cab that rested on the
ground just 51 feet south from the benchmark that still exists. It
was in use until 1952, and then destroyed in 1965. There are no
remains of the lookout, but there are still some pieces of a
foundation left from another structure. I am doing some research on
the lookout, but as of now that is all I have.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The best route is to walk up from the bottom of the butte, but if
you do want to ride up in a vehicle, there is a road that starts to
the south of the butte and goes to the top. BE WARNED: The best
place to park is about 350 feet short of the cache. There is a good
turnaround spot here and a nice place to park. The road from here
up is rather rough and not for the faint of heart. To the parking /
turnaround spot, a high clearance vehicle should suit you fine. I
would not do it in your grandmothers Cadillac though.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is about 30 feet due north (true) from the &lt;a href=
"http://www.geocaching.com/mark/details.aspx?PID=PB0692"&gt;benchmark&lt;/a&gt;.
It is under a stump hidden by some wood and rocks. From the
benchmark, follow the manzanita to a small opening that leads into
the trees. Please re-hide well as there are signs of muggles up
here.&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Winter Jaunts – Views, starts with “Arches, Caves and Views, Oh My” traditional cache. The starting waypoint is under the lid.  I placed these a few days after a winter storm, so they should still be in good shape to find even if there is a few inches of snow on the ground.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Do you need a longer hike, but it's the middle of winter and you don't nowhere to go.  Well, try this walk to stretch your legs.  The snow won't be as deep, so no snowshoes are required and, well shoot, there just might not be any snow anyhow.  It tends to be a little sunnier and warmer out here in the Badlands and this little jaunt for some great views of the Cascades might just be the ticket to help burn off all those leftovers you ate after your holiday festivities.
Once you find “Arches, Caves and Views, Oh My”, there are 4 waypoints and then the final.  You will have to do some walking though, 'cause the viewpoints are where they are and I didn't want to move them any closer together, so you'll just have to go and walked to them yourself.  It's about 4.7 miles as the crow flies for the round trip from the nearest area to park.  Which happens to be near “Arches, Caves and Views, Oh My”

really helps when you start out with the correct coords.  after a miscue when we started this one a while back today's trip was a snap.  numbers were all balls on and wp's were for the most part easy to find.  deadheaded back after wp4 and then drove to about 400' of the final.  thanks for your work on this series as we had fun just moseying along today.</groundspeak:text>

The cache hounds enjoyed their hike today. It was 75 out so Ollie got a little hot and we almost didn't have enough water for them - used the last about 1/2 mile from the car where they had more water stashed (sometimes I think I take better care of their needs than my own). We enjoyed our hike too but I was wishing I had brought more water for me as I had to share Slow's Gatorade. Thanks for the multi cache. It felt like 5 caches - oh wait, it was 5 stops. Ok, so I am tired I just accidentally logged we had found Caves instead of Views. Now to undo that mess.</groundspeak:text>

started with bessie #6 and worked my way up also climbing a couple of buttes for 3 additional caches. mt. molly and mt. samantha were pretty easy with slopes not too bad and little brush to contend with. swampy butte i went straight up the north side which is steep and a lot of down trees plus brush. took my time so it wasn't too bad. found a more open way to come down a little to the west.

finished up the bessie part and then came down the swampy series making a big loop of things. nobody out and the temps stayed cool. been a while since i have been in some of that country.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Part of the classic sci-fi movie series on Pine Mountain for the annual Geo-Star Party. When you are not star gazing or caching, watch a movie in the tent at the observatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache and two others are on the way up to the paraport. You can drive fairly close to the cache with a high-clearance vehicle. The road is narrow with few places to pull over (see waypoint for recommended parking). It is also a nice hike of less than a mile from the gate near the main road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Island of Doctor Moreau&lt;/i&gt; is an 1896 science fiction novel by H. G. Wells. It is a disturbing story of a scientist who attempts to convert animals into human beings on a remote island. At the time there was growing discussion in Europe regarding degeneration and animal vivisection. The novel deals with themes of pain and cruelty, moral responsibility, human identity, and interference with nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three movies were made from the novel, including &lt;i&gt;Island of Lost Souls&lt;/i&gt; in 1932, and &lt;i&gt;The Island of Dr. Moreau&lt;/i&gt; in 1977 and 1996. &lt;i&gt;Island of Lost Souls&lt;/i&gt; starred Charles Laughton, Richard Arlen, Leila Hyams, Bela Lugosi and Kathleen Burke as the Panther Woman. It was initially banned in the UK because it portrayed cruelty to animals. H. G. Wells felt that the film's overt horror elements overshadowed the story's deeper philosophical meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film is the source of the saying "The natives are restless tonight." It has inspired many songs including Devo's "Are We Not Men?," Oingo Boingo's "No Spill Blood," Van Halen's "House of Pain," and the stage act of horror-rock band the Manimals.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;While traveling cross country in the spring of 2014, I attended a Maker's Madness Event in Jamestown, ND (GC50DET).  It was held at a truckstop, and I got to visit with cachers from ND and MN.  Our hosts, NOSND, handed each of us a brown paper bag, each containing a ready-to-go cache.  Born at a truckstop, and planted at a truck stop.  Take care of all you travel needs while you're on the road and stopping for this cache.&lt;/p&gt;
If you're on a long trip or a trucker, I'd love to know that in your log. I'm curious about how many truckers cache.

#45 to honor our veterans and active duty personnel. Please drive
and park on the gravel and respect the area. I have approval to
place this cache and if anyone should question you explain that
this is an approved Geocache and refer them to the bartender.&lt;br /&gt;
I started this cache with several swags, one Geocoin, and two
Travelbugs. Please register the travelbugs and Geocoin if you take
them, the American Flag coin is mine and I would like it to visit
as many Veteran/Active duty military places as possible.&lt;br /&gt;

all we do for our Military men and women as well as our local

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a grab and go with great parking close by.  Mother Nature asks you to please stay on the dirt road parking area and do not drive up to the cache.    Please leave it as well hid or better.  Lots of mugglers pass by this backroad site.  FTF Unregistered 2012 Pine Mountain Star Party geo coin.  We have placed the lost canoe TB in this cache as well.  Hopefully he will make it a little further along and not go missing in a river. Batchelor butte can be seen looking north.  A more familiar name is Mount Batchelor but it is really a butte and not a mountain.  The name sounds better for tourists, ski bums and mountain bikers.  The lodge, ski area and soon to be mountain bike trails are a great place to visit summer or winter.  Lifts run in the winter for sking and boarding and in the summer they take you to the top for some great views. We have replaced the missing ammo can with one smaller. I believe the local police removed it, thinking it might be a drug drop or something along that line. Consider them when you locate the new container. They may also think it slowed drivers down for their location over the hill is good for speeders going north.

&lt;p&gt;Moderate hike on the main Pine Mountain ridge which you can start at either end. Several other caches along the way. Part of the classic sci-fi cache series on Pine Mountain for the annual Geo-Star Party. When you are not star gazing or caching, watch a movie in the tent at the observatory.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&lt;/i&gt; is a 1956 film based on the novel The Body Snatchers. It is the first and most critically acclaimed of the novel's four film adaptations. The black and white film is deemed culturally significant by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry, and it is considered one of the 10 best sci-fi films of all time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story takes place in the fictional town of Santa Mira, California, where people are being replaced by perfect physical duplicates grown from giant plant-like pods. The Pod People are indistinguishable from normal people, except for their utter lack of emotion. The movie echoes the paranoid political tone of its time, and the actual end of the story is left open.&lt;/p&gt;

I passed many high mounds of detached logs and branches, perfect for wildlife shelter, I would think, not that those piles are permanently in place. It was a bit creepy, really, as I walked through the shadowed, sunken grade, checking for suspicious-looking pods along the way. I decided this was not the best of places to lie down and take a nap. But lo, the final ascent is already upon me, and this cache is pointing the way up and out. TNLS</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Part of the classic sci-fi movie series on Pine Mountain for the annual Geo-Star Party. When you are not star gazing or caching, watch a movie in the tent at the observatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache and two others are on the way up to the paraport. You can drive fairly close to the cache with a high-clearance vehicle; note that the road is narrow with few places to pull over. It is also a nice hike of about a mile from the gate near the main road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Quatermass Xperiment&lt;/i&gt; is a 1955 British science fiction horror film based on an earlier TV series about the eponymous Professor Bernard Quatermass, Britain's first television hero. The film had a successful run in the U.S. as the &lt;i&gt;Creeping Unknown&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in the later &lt;i&gt;Planet of the Apes&lt;/i&gt;, an astronaut returns to Earth. He is the only survivor of the crew and is infected with an alien organism that threatens to destroy humanity. Professor Quatermass must save the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film pioneered adult sci-fi horror and is considered one of the best alien invasion stories. A couple of well-regarded Quatermass movie sequels and TV series were produced. My favorite was the 1967 &lt;i&gt;Quatermass and the Pit&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Five Million Years to Earth&lt;/i&gt; in the U.S.).&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache is at the highest point on Pine Mountain, a little over 6500'.  It could be cold and windy even in the summer, so come prepared.  The views are awesome in all directions (bring your camera).  I had mine today but soon found out I had left the SD card in the printer at home.  I'm putting this cache out just prior to the 7th Annual Pine Mountain Geo-Star Party, so plan to attend a great event and find many nice caches in the Pine Mountain area.  Not many places to hide a regular ammo can, so finding the cache won't be a challenge, but it will require a steep climb from any direction you come in from. I parked near the "Not Napster" cache and it was about .36 up from there. Wanted to put the cache up at the little tree right on top, but forgot how hard it is to hide a 50-cal. ammo can.  Bet this area gets lots of hunter's in the fall, so try to hide it better than you found it.</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I emerged from the shadowy, detritus-ridden valley between these high places and slowly climbed the final grade. What a difference there is up here! All sun and light, with only one stunted tree to impede my progress. Well, there are still lots of rocks on the ground, but those are the price of doing business here. I zeroed in on the cache and found it easily; I really appreciate all the goodly-sized caches on these searches. Then I took a few photos of a couple trackables by that beautiful, lone tree. TNLS

I'm at a point in my caching activity where I don't feel a need to find everything in one session, so I decided that this was a good stopping point for the day. I headed back the way I came, just enjoying the hike and the view now, and arrived back at my car just a few minutes after 10am. I spent the rest of the day recuperating in Bend, where I discovered a new restaurant/brewery and visited my favorite museum and bookstore. Boy, I can get used to this kind of life.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This is the starting place for all three of the Winter Jaunts.  I must give thanks to Bad Dogs for finding this area and sharing it with the “12 Days of Christmas” series.  I really enjoyed it and was sad to see so many of the cache containers in decay.  So, I helped cleaned them up and redesigned the leftovers into this series.  I hope you enjoy the area as much as I have.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">If you want to find the Winter Jaunts, you are in the right place.  This is where all three start.  Under the lid you will find the first waypoint for each of the jaunts.  Yes, that means there are 3 first waypoints and 3 different legs of the Winter Jaunts series.  But, if all you want is an easy, not to far off the road cache to find, this can be that cache, too. A good place to park is very nearby, but be careful with your winter parking.  This road doesn't get plowed and the parking spot (one car) is just off road in the dirt, without four-wheel drive it could be very easy to get stuck.  But, with that being said, if there is no snow you can get in here with any car, the road is paved.
So, you want to get out, but not in the snow or just to catch a little more sun?  Head on out to the Badlands.  The three jaunts range in distance from 2.7 to 4.7 miles.  They are each sure to work off the extra helpings from holiday dinners.  There are a lot of interesting tumulus rock formations and from the top of the hill, great views of the Cascades and other surrounding hills, buttes and Pine Mountain.  For those who are quiet enough and observant, you can also see a lot of wildlife.
Each of the waypoints for the jaunts are metal tins I have collected that vary in size from an Altoids tin up to a holiday chocolate tin.  I have placed each so that they can be seen without having to move anything to spot them.  Hopefully they will stay that way, though some are easier than others.</groundspeak:long_description>

Parking at the end of the road now lengthens the hike to about a three mile round trip. The waypoint and cache are in great shape. After checking on the cache we hiked up and had lunch on a log at the top of the lava "waterfall".  A great view of the surrounding area.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Headed out on this cool day to do some hiking on and around the lava. This was my eighth and last stop and one of five caches I hiked on lava for today. Managed to find a less traveled road (NF-490)and drove within .25 of first waypoint before deciding I had taken the 4X4 high-clearance (and now pen-striped)geomobile far enough. As I discovered walking down the road I probably could have driven to the first waypoint and about half-way to the cache had I chose to go further. This is not, however, a drive for your geomobile if you cherish your paint job as it will get "brushed"[:D]. Made quick work of the waypoint and hiked on down the old road to the final instead of bushwacking. Made for a little longer trip but an easier one as I was getting tired. Loved your series of caches in the lava and have marked them all as favorites. TFTH. TNL Virtual geocoin &amp; "[b][pink]DUBBLE BUBBLE[/b][/pink]"SL</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Location: N43:40.712  W120:48.950
Container: Small Gatorade can.
Elev.: 5240 feet

This location is on a Cinder Cone Southeast of Pine Mountain out in the Sagebrush and Pines. There are several other caches out this way so make a day of it.

Should be an easy find for most people and I do need you to replace the cache back where you find it. If you find it. I went in when there was a lot of snow on the ground but after the snow melts, you should be able to get the town car close enough for just a short hike to the cache.

Anyhow, your looking for a small Gatorade container with small trade items in it and only room for like items. I had thought I had more ammo cans with me but grabbed the wrong box so this will have to do.  You should be able to get the container with out much trouble.

Please be aware that there is a memorial type container close by in a white Tupperware container. That is not the cache so leave it alone for the owners family.

Moffit or Sand Springs road is the best access from the North.  After that, your on your own.

TFTC ! From a french geocacheur visiting Oregon for the very first time :)

I wonder how a lot of GC are so rarely found around here !!!

In my old Europe :) GC are found very often and it is a kind of race to be FTF ;-D
Even in deep forests or difficult to reach places...

&lt;p&gt;Short distance off a single-lane forest road. Pull-off near by. Be sure to get the coords for the bonus cache, &lt;a href="http://coord.info/GC5XFN5"&gt;Zyra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the classic sci-fi cache series on Pine Mountain for the annual Geo-Star Party. When you are not star gazing or caching, watch a movie in the tent at the observatory.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;When Worlds Collide&lt;/i&gt; is a 1951 follow-up to &lt;i&gt;Destination Moon&lt;/i&gt; by George Pal. It is based on a 1933 novel of the same name which tells of Earth's coming destruction by the rogue star Bellus and our desperate efforts to build a space ark that will transport a select few to the star's single orbiting planet, Zyra. The film was called a "doomsday parable for the nuclear age of the '50s" and received mixed reviews but has become a classic sci-fi fixture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Factoids: &lt;i&gt;When Worlds Collide&lt;/i&gt; is one of the films referenced in the opening of &lt;i&gt;The Rocky Horror Show&lt;/i&gt;. In the feature film &lt;i&gt;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&lt;/i&gt; (1982), two cargo containers can be seen labeled "Bellus" and "Zyra" in the Genesis Cave. As in most George Pal movies Woody Woodpecker appears, this time in an airport shot at the beginning of the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that Pine Mountain summit is directly above to the south, only a quarter-mile and 400 feet of elevation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">A great and Scenic Hike.... There is a brand new 14 Channel FRS 2way radio for the first finder  and loads of other fun stuff.    </groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Not for the weak in the knees... The Cache requires some short but abrupt changes in elevation and really should not be attempted by children and DEFINATLY not a night cache and you should think twice about attempiting it in the snow. Our two big black dogs made it but they had to put it in 4wd. 
The cache should have a couple of surpises...  The view being one !
But don't be fooled into thinking the short distance means you can stroll in and stroll out in ten minutes... at least allow some time to enjoy the beauty of the view ! This is one of my favorite spots ... ENJOY !

The drive in is mostly nice but a couple of spots where a car would go really SLOW!  a high clearance vehicle would be the ticket...   You will need some sturdy legs and sturdy boots...   You do not need advanced climbing skills but choose your path wisely !


 The original cache contains:
12 channel frs 2way radio
compass
Chunks of polished petrified wood
Survival knife
pocket knife
electronic dictionary
pez
beenie baby
some other misc.
and dog treats from the two big black dogs

This is one of my favorite spots ... ENJOY 

MY SMALL PRINT :
 the hide is a 3.5 because the gps gets a little nutty here so  take the sheet in case you need the hint...    ALSO it is a short hike but can be hairy in places, choose your path wisely... 



This cache was planned and the day prior to the set up I lost a good friend and wonderful lady.. The cache is dedicated to Ruby who will be missed by many!

We found one of the trails to the top and down into the bowl. We were hunting in the wrong area until we reviewed the clue and took it literally and poof found the GZ.  Really cool place, we were just saying that if it weren't for geocaching we'd never would have found this place!!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Winter Jaunts – Arches, starts with “Arches, Caves and Views, Oh My” traditional cache. The starting waypoint is under the lid.  I placed these a few days after a winter storm, so they should still be in good shape to find even if there is a few inches of snow on the ground.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Do you need a little hike, but it's the middle of winter and you have nowhere to go.  Well, try this hike to your liking.  You may never need snowshoes in the Badlands. The snow just doesn't get that deep, and well heck, there just might not be any snow anyhow.  It tends to be a little sunnier and warmer out here in the Badlands and this little jaunt to see a few tumulus arches might just be the ticket to help burn off the heap of appetizers you ate at your holiday feast.
Once you find “Arches, Caves and Views, Oh My”, there are 3 waypoints and then the final.  You will have to do some walking though, 'cause I couldn't move the arches any closer together, so you'll just have to go to the arches.  It's a little over 3.8 miles as the crow flies for the round trip from the nearest area to park.  Which happens to be near “Arches, Caves and Views, Oh My”.

You may also walk the road (please close the gate) 1.25 miles with 500’ altitude gain or bushwhack from the main Pine Mountain road, nearly a mile with 1000’ of altitude gain. From the parking site, the cache finding is easy, the road in is not. Snow may prevent access during the winter.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is the second in our airport series. It is not your usual airport. But rather a Paraport, used by Paragliders for foot launching their flying machines. They are often here on summer afternoons, riding the wind blowing up the west face of this butte. Another 1000’ up the trail is the highest point, with a commanding 360° view. If you are the adventurous type you can camp out and enjoy the awesome sunset, as seen from the top of the world. Camping is also available at the nearby Pine Mountain Observatory. 

The cache is a regular ammo can with the usual stuff inside. Please rehide it carefully, to retain the natural appearance.

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The 2nd of my La Pine Parks and Recreation caches. The Finley Butte Community Park has a long local history. At one time Frontier Days and the Rodeo were held here. The Community building was built by the original La Pine Lions Club that at one time was the largest Lions Club in the state of Oregon with 140 members. Alas, the club membership dropped for a variety of reasons and the club dissolved after donating the park and facilities to La Pine Parks and Recreation.&lt;br /&gt;
I needed to move this cache and rename it, landscaping removed the prior area. You may park your vehicle in the parking lot and make the short walk to this one. Log and pen in container, please reseal and face the blue lid into the hide so it doesn't show. Enjoy our parks! **Note if there is a ball game going on you should come back to this one at another time.**

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I wasn't sure I should go for this one today, considering the difficulties the previous searches have documented. But hey, I had hiked quite the distance to get close to here already, and the cache was thought to be just a bit further up the path, and it was still well before noon, so I figured I might as well see what I could see. And, yes indeed, there is another side to the mountain.

There are also a mess of termites at the peak, which have taken over the pole structures there. Some were flying around and trying to get inside my ears and nose. I decided not to overstay my welcome once I had confirmed that the cache wasn't theoretically located in such a muggle-prone area. But someone needs to take a barrel of Raid to this place, if such a thing is allowed.

I made my way to the published GZ and looked around. Oh great. Rocks all around. Well, I expected that, but I didn't expect them all to look the same. Luckily I also spotted a small, man-made, rock cairn, for which I am grateful, because it means the CO actually wants the cache to be found by others; after all, the major effort of this search is just hiking up to this place, and it would be upsetting not to find the cache after all that. The only problem, I eventually realized, is that it's not the only formation up here that could be interpreted to be a small, man-made, rock cairn--and I was looking at the wrong one.

I spotted another one at just about the same vector documented in a previous log. It was well beyond the tolerance from the coords my GPSr was giving me, but others have had better luck there, so off I went. It was still a frustrating search, given that I lost my own sense of direction in this field of sameness, but I somehow managed to move the correct rock and uncover the cache--and the guard!--within a short while.

The guard was seemingly docile as I moved him carefully out of the way, but of course, that's what these creatures want you to think. Still, he quietly watched from a safe distance as I opened the cache and signed the log. I introduced a dragonfly trackable to the guard (again, from a safe distance), since I'll bet all those termites at the peak would be a great source of food for it. Then again, the dragonfly would be a great source of food for the guard, so I decided to let them work it out.

If I've remembered to do so, I'm appending the coords I took at true GZ, an average of five samples taken over ten minutes on a cloudless day close to noon, and employing scientific rounding, because both figures were on the bubble. I don't mind a reasonable search time, depending on the difficulty level. The posted difficulty level here (2.5) is appropriate with the rock cairn in place; I'd rank it higher (3.5) without the cairn, but it really would be nice to start the search somewhere closer to true GZ.

Thanks for the extended adventure.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is a recycled cache container from Bad Dogs, original “12 days of Christmas” series done here in the area that I helped to remove.  I was able to piece together 3 cache containers out of the 12 placed, so I thought I would place them back out here.  What else are you going to do with an old cache box.  So, I will leave it up to the current finder to decide if the cache should stay or go.  If you think the container will last for the next cacher to come along, then let'er lie.  If you think it will no longer hold out, then please just take the whole container and let me know when you log your find and I will promptly archive the site.  I think the container should last at least another year or two, especially if no one places rocks on top of the cache box.
This is a nice high point with a good view of a couple mountains and some cool tumulus rock formations.  If you are quiet enough there is also a lot of wildlife in the area.  While I was out exploring the area I seen Cottontails, Jack Rabbits, a few nice Bucks and their harem of Doe's, Grouse, a Screech Owl and several other birds, even had some Coyote nearby, but never actually seen them. Plus, a bunch of tracks in the snow.</groundspeak:long_description>

Stenkamp and his men followed the draft, but went only as far as the lavacicles and came out dazzled by the spectacle.  You’ll notice the same brisk draft that revealed the cave’s location to Stenkamp as you peer inside the entrance today but you won’t get to see any lavacicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lavacicle Cave is unique because of the well-developed lava pinnacles rising from the floor.  The formations resemble common stalagmites and stalactites, however, they were formed by cooling lava rather than by dripping water.  Geologists have observed that certain lava tubes served as channelways for later lava flows. Evidence of these younger flows is seen along the walls in the form of projecting shelves and gutters, representing the various stages of flooding as the lava stream rose and fell. Apparently, Lavacicle Cave was temporarily filled to the roof by a younger flow. Immediately after this lava drained out of the tube, the molten material coating the ceiling dripped to the floor, building pinnacles of rock. The tallest lavacicle was reported 6 feet high; hundreds of others scattered over the floor range from 1 to 2 feet in height. In contrast, lavacicles on the ceiling are only a few inches in length.  Over the years many of these lavacicles have been vandalized and broken.  One of the largest and most beautiful formations, the so-called Horse Head was actually stolen from the cave, never to be seen again.  So to protect what was left, the U.S. Forest Service declared the cave permanently closed and installed steel grating which allows the bats to enter and exit but not people.  Yes, I’m afraid it’s another example of a few bad apples ruining a great experience for the rest of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting at the cave entrance is still a great place to cool off on a hot day.  And now it’s a great destination to chalk up another smiley … you’re looking for an ammo can with all the usual swag.&lt;/p&gt;
Congrats to 55c3pu for FTF and scoring that awesome Swiss Army Knife!

TFTC ! From a french geocacheur visiting Oregon for the very first time :)

I wonder how a lot of GC are so rarely found around here !!!

In my old Europe :) GC are found very often and it is a kind of race to be FTF ;-D
Even in deep forests or difficult to reach places...

Anyway, thanks again to all owners In the State where it all belonged !</groundspeak:text>

I bet there were a few people wondering why this little ol' lady was tramping off into the woods by herself, in sandals! I did find the cache, despite the fact that my GPS toy was wonky. There weren't any TBs in the container, though. Sure wish people would remember to log them out.

started with bessie #6 and worked my way up also climbing a couple of buttes for 3 additional caches. mt. molly and mt. samantha were pretty easy with slopes not too bad and little brush to contend with. swampy butte i went straight up the north side which is steep and a lot of down trees plus brush. took my time so it wasn't too bad. found a more open way to come down a little to the west.

finished up the bessie part and then came down the swampy series making a big loop of things. nobody out and the temps stayed cool. been a while since i have been in some of that country.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;I always seemed to approach this spot from the north and could not help to think the formations to the southeast from here looked like a set of giant gun sights.&amp;nbsp; And those gun sights were the original site for one of the &amp;ldquo;12 Days of Christmas&amp;rdquo; that this box was pieced together from.&amp;nbsp; If you have time they are worth going over to check out.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">This cache is located in the Sugarpine Butte area. This cache
involves driving a number of low standard roads so a vehicle with
high clearance is advisable and if you want to drive as far as
possible a 4x4 would be helpful. There is some walking for short
distances on young lava flows so wear sturdy hard soled shoes.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The first point is located at N 43° 49.634’, W 121° 22.395’ and you
are looking for a 3”x2”x1/2” metal tin with instructions inside.
The tin is in a tree mold on the North Sugarpine lava flow. This
flow vented from fissure vents which cut the flank of the much
older Sugarpine Butte. Depending on the route you choose you may
pass these vents on your way to the second point. This flow is a
pahoehoe flow and is quite thin and contains many tree molds. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The actual cache (ammo can) is located on the South Sugarpine lava
flow which was erupted from an unnamed butte south of Sugarpine
Butte. This flow in contrast to the North Sugarpine flow is what is
known as an aa flow and is much thicker. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Both of these flows were erupted from the NW Rift zone of Newberry
Volcano about 7000 years ago. The early part of the eruption was
gas rich resulting in spatter ramparts along fissures and pahoehoe
flows. After the gas rich magma was erupted the eruptive style
changed and a cinder cone and thick aa flow was erupted. From the
cache site there is a good view of the summit area of Newberry
Volcano to the south. The volcano actually extends northward almost
to Bend.</groundspeak:long_description>

The first waypoint was tricky, we had left the clue in the car so were winging it. Finally found not one, but two Altoids tins, stacked on top of each other. Oh well, off to find the next waypoint. 

We followed the previous finder's advice about which road to take and were soon driving on a fabulous lava road and then hiking through a gorgeous park-like area and back onto the flow. After making the find and snapping some pix, we checked our maps and figured we were very close to Highway 97 via Forest Road 9725, and decided to take that way out....but were blocked by a fallen tree (see photo).

We tried all our tricks to move it out of the way but it was a green tree and so weighed a ton. No go. Back all the way around to the original road in to Sugarpine Butte. 

What a great adventure, we loved this cache. Uber-favorite!</groundspeak:text>

As I got close to GZ , the snow was getting deeper and I am post holing ! At GZ the snow is almost 2 feet deep- I just keep saying- well- it is one star- and then I see NO HINT.  I am pleased to report this really is a ONE star because, despite the snow, it was in the second place I looked. When I say, LOOKED, I mean, the second place I had to dig. Now, if you really want it to be easy, go now , since you'll see  where I dug in the snow! Thanks for the star for my fizzy!</groundspeak:text>

Well, here is your chance!&lt;br /&gt;
This chache series was modeled after one by &lt;a href=

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This Smiley series has 23 caches and 1
bonus. The smiley is about one mile across (approximately 3.14
miles in circumfrence).&lt;br /&gt;
This series starts along an existing road, but cross-country travel
is needed from there.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The caches range in size from small Tupperware containers to 50mm
ammo cans. Be on the lookout for anything! They are all full of
swag and there are unactivated coins for FTF in some of them.&lt;br /&gt;
You will want to strategically plan where you start so you have a
chance at one of the first to find prizes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rumor has it that the Easter Bunny may have showed up to leave an
egg or two along the way!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember to save the color and n umber from the lid/log book from
each cache, it's your key to the bonus. Make sure you bring paper
and a pencil to keep track of your numbers.&lt;br /&gt;
Have fun and please rehide well!&lt;br /&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Great multi, us and the dogs had a great time making this find today.  The manzanita is building a very natural fence around this one and may not be very accessible for many more years.  But the cache and all the waypoints are in excellent condition and the coords are spot on.  One very curious detail though, we were only the second to sign the log ... right behind Markellie, the FTF.  This leads me to believe that others have maybe made the same mistake that we almost made.  When we found the third hide it was marked "Final" with some coords.  At first we thought that we had just found the final but then realized that the coords were different than those that we had just gotten from the second waypoint to find this location.  So we headed off to those new coords and found what wasn't so camouflaged ... a bright orange container with a log and trinkets to trade.  Soooo ... moral to the story is that there's four parts to this one, not just three.  Thanks for the hide, most definitely get a fav point form us.</groundspeak:text>

Interesting little formation.  Not sure how it was formed but you should find it interesting. Kid and dog friendly, just be careful of where you step if you get on top of it. If you look from the underside on the North side entrance, you will be able to see just how thin the roof on some of these primary features really are.

Please take nothing but photos, and trade items from the cache, and leave anything else where you find them. If you find them.

Once you find this cache, you need to write down the number you find written on the inside of the lid.  This number will work into the formula for locating the BONUS cache. The bonus cache is right at 0.72 miles away across country as the Raven flies. I told you I was wandering around in the trees. 

Your looking for another one of those plastic 6 quart boxes painted green to take the shine off.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="Arial"&gt;Here is a multi-cache that should be easy and fun. &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="Arial"&gt;The cache is placed for the 2010 Pine Mountain Star Party Event.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/c00d7cf0-e79e-4d1b-b71d-52662a043308.jpg" width="577" height="460" /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="Arial"&gt;According to mythology, the Phoenix was a mythical bird of incredible beauty who would live for 500 to 1,000 years. The fire spirit with colorful plumage and a tail of gold and scarlet (or purple, blue, and green according to some legends). The bird would build a nest of twigs and leaves that would be lit by the noon sun. Both nest and bird burn fiercely and are reduced to ashes, from which a new, young phoenix or phoenix egg arises, reborn anew to live again. The new phoenix is destined to live as long as its old self. In some stories, the new phoenix embalms the ashes of its old self in an egg made of myrrh and deposits it in the Egyptian city &lt;font color="#000000"&gt;of Heliopolis (Greek f&lt;/font&gt;or sun-city). It is said that the bird's cry is that of a beautiful song. In very few stories they are able to change into people.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="Arial"&gt;This constellation, almost universally recognized as a bird, has also been called The Griffin, The Eagle, The Young Ostriches (Arabic), and The Fire Bird (Chinese). It was named Phoenix by Johann Bayer in 1603.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="6" color="#0000FF"&gt;About the Phoenix Constellation&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#000000" size="4" face="Arial"&gt;Phoenix is a minor constellation in the southern sky. It is named after the Phoenix, a mythical bird. It is faint; there are only two stars in the whole constellation which are brighter than magnitude 5.0. Alpha Phoenicis is named Ankaa, an Arabic word meaning 'the boat'.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#000000" size="4" face="Arial"&gt;The constellation stretches from roughly -39° to -57° declination, and from 23.5h to 2.5h of right ascension. This means it is generally invisible to anyone living north of the 40th parallel in the Northern Hemisphere, and remains low in the sky for anyone living north of the equator. It is easily visible from locations such as Australia and South Africa during Southern Hemisphere summer.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="Arial"&gt;Here is one way to learn about this constellation from Pine Mountain Observatory.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#0000FF" face="Arial" size="6"&gt;Quick Facts&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="Arial"&gt;Name:   Phoenix FEE-nix&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="Arial"&gt;Meaning:   Phoenix (Type of Bird)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="Arial"&gt;Abbreviation:   Phe&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="Arial"&gt;Genitive:    Phoenicis&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="Arial"&gt;Visible in Latitudes:   30° thru -90°&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="Arial"&gt;Viewing Season:   Fall&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="Arial"&gt;Best Seen In:   November, 9:00 pm&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="Arial"&gt;Transit Date:   September 29&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="Arial"&gt;Right Ascension:   0.70 hours&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="Arial"&gt;Declination:   -48.8 degrees&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="Arial"&gt;Area:   469.319 sq. degrees&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="6"&gt;&lt;font color="#0000FF"&gt;Phoenix Cache&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="Arial"&gt;The first waypoint is a large bucket that you get your final coords posted under the lid.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="Arial"&gt;Final is another typical container.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="Arial"&gt;High clearance vehicle advised.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="Arial"&gt;Good luck, have fun.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="Arial"&gt;8/13/2011  Cache updated and very easy now. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Had plotted this point on our map, but didn't have coords for it, as POTP mentioned in his log.

Fortunately Special K knew that it was here and had an overhead that showed where it was in relation to other caches. Didn't have coordinates, but we managed to navigate to the right general area. Once close I got enough of a cell signal to find some coordinates. Turned out we were only about 50 meters off at that point, so I think we might have found it anyway. Thanks!</groundspeak:text>

Well, here is your chance!&lt;br /&gt;
This chache series was modeled after one by &lt;a href=

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This Smiley series has 23 caches and 1
bonus. The smiley is about one mile across (approximately 3.14
miles in circumfrence).&lt;br /&gt;
This series starts along an existing road, but cross-country travel
is needed from there.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The caches range in size from small Tupperware containers to 50mm
ammo cans. Be on the lookout for anything! They are all full of
swag and there are unactivated coins for FTF in some of them.&lt;br /&gt;
You will want to strategically plan where you start so you have a
chance at one of the first to find prizes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rumor has it that the Easter Bunny may have showed up to leave an
egg or two along the way!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember to save the color and n umber from the lid/log book from
each cache, it's your key to the bonus. Make sure you bring paper
and a pencil to keep track of your numbers.&lt;br /&gt;
Have fun and please rehide well!&lt;br /&gt;

It's a great series, with lots of hiking, interesting landscapes, and delightful, swag-filled caches.  We especially appreciated the ammo cans!  Thank you for placing them!!

Madge Ellen took us to an auspicious spot, and we looked it over but found nothing.  Expanded our search, still nothing.  Madge still wanted us where she took us first, and after much more careful searching, Sow finally came up with it.  It wasn't that hard, really; we just weren't thorough enough.

Well, here is your chance!&lt;br /&gt;
This chache series was modeled after one by &lt;a href=

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This Smiley series has 23 caches and 1
bonus. The smiley is about one mile across (approximately 3.14
miles in circumfrence).&lt;br /&gt;
This series starts along an existing road, but cross-country travel
is needed from there.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The caches range in size from small Tupperware containers to 50mm
ammo cans. Be on the lookout for anything! They are all full of
swag and there are unactivated coins for FTF in some of them.&lt;br /&gt;
You will want to strategically plan where you start so you have a
chance at one of the first to find prizes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rumor has it that the Easter Bunny may have showed up to leave an
egg or two along the way!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember to save the color and n umber from the lid/log book from
each cache, it's your key to the bonus. Make sure you bring paper
and a pencil to keep track of your numbers.&lt;br /&gt;
Have fun and please rehide well!&lt;br /&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is one of three multi-stage, puzzle geocaches sponsored by Deschutes Public Library. You will have to solve three puzzles to find the physical cache, which will take you on a tour of two of Deschutes Public Library's branches.

The listed coordinates will lead you close to the front door of one our libraries.  Enter the library and locate a blue wall. Look for a memorial name plate on a shelf near that blue wall. How many letters are in her full name?  Add 90 to that number.

Now you have solved for "XX" in the coordinates: 43.51.XX3

While you are in the library, nab a quick cache called Book Nook (not affiliated with Deschutes Public Library but placed with the support and encouragement of staff): http://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC39FDY_book-nook?guid=8773464f-49b9-478d-b53a-ee83d8147959

Once you are outside the library again, look for a dedication sign by the front door.  What year was the library built? Add 611 to that number

Now you have solved for "YYYY" in the coordinates: 121.YY.YY5

Use the new coordinates to take you close to the front door of a similar building. Enter the building and locate a book to find the cache. The book is entitled THE HISTORY OF LOVE. This is your clue: Dewey Decimal System Call #KRAUSS, NICOLE (in the FICTION section)

she kind of remembered a name so i could get enough info to find the cache.  even without the plaque one can use some geosense plus logic to come up with the find.  

might want to edit the description to make this more doable for some folks.</groundspeak:text>

We got to this cache after finding almost all the others and are frustrated, because after all that, we can't do the final.  There was no way to hide a regular cache at GZ, and hiding a small would be pretty difficult.  Surrounding areas yielded nothing.  We think this cache should be checked on ASAP so no other cachers have to suffer.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Well, this is supposed to be the end of the road but if you really, really want to go further, there are some old skid roads out there you might travel. Just be sure that you don’t want your paint job anymore.  This cache is at the end of the cul-de-sac and makes for a great parking spot for you to adventure from. There is some sort of trail cut through the area as well. Where is starts or where it goes I do not know. Horse, Deer and Elk tracks where all I seen on it as I crossed it several times.

Your looking for another one of those 6 quart plastic boxes painted green to take the shine off of it.  Make sure you have plenty of fuel and a spare tire before slinking your way in here. And as always in Central Oregon, Be prepared for any and all types of weather.

THE POSTED NUMBERS ARE NOT WHERE THE CACHE IS LOCATED AT.

You will have to work for it if you want to log this one.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I was out wandering around through the Lodgepole and Ponderosa Pine and I came across a couple real neat rock formations. This is one of the better ones and I just had an idea I knew a flock of people who just might like to see them.  There are more of these formations out here but as for right now, you will have to make do with these or find the others on your own.

I got the name for this cache from an old logging cable laying right close by. Please respect the area, take only from the cache if you take anything other then photos and be careful.  This cache id fine for kids and dogs. Kids will have a blast at both here and the Squirrel Tunnel cache.

Anyway to get this cache, you will need the numbers you wrote down from the underside of the Squirrel Crossing cache lid - GCNZ6N.

N 43:53.AAA  ( ???? - 1565 = AAA )

W 121:12.BBB  ( ???? - 1508 = BBB )

Your looking for another one of those 6 quart plastic boxes with an assortment of items inside.

Oh one more thing, Bring a couple flashlights and check out the area. Several locations you want to look at.

Please take care of your dogs in this park; Please read the park rules sign; Please read the various kiosk boards before heading to the above posted location.

Bring a lunch and some water for your stay, enjoy a one of a kind feature to be seen nowhere else like it.  If you come in the spring and summer, you will see various Species of Hawks, Falcons, Ravens and some Eagles in the air, nesting or sitting on the Rimrock. 

Hike the trail around the inside of the Fort, being careful of not packing anything but trash back out.  Bring your optic’s and sit on the North Rim and watch for Elk, Pronghorns, Mulies, Coyotes and lots of other critters roaming the Sage.

Now to claim this as a find, you will need to go to the posted cords and tell me how many plaques you find and what they are mounted on. Not the signs, there are bronze plaques to locate.

DO NOT POST YOUR ANSWER TO THE WEB. SEND THEM TO ME OR I WILL HAVE TO SEND YOU A NOTE AND HAVE YOU FIX IT.

For extra credit, tell me the what the person’s name is who donated this area to the people of the State of Oregon.  If you get a chance, locate his book and read it, it will open your eyes to the life of the Oregon High Desert.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This earthcache is an easy drive SE of Bend. There is little shade, and an easy walking path taking you into the dormant volcanic crater. You will want to spend some time here; bring your lunch and absorb the splendor.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Here you will see an example of volcanic activity mixed with water, and will show you the persistent and powerful effects of water. This awesome sight that can be seen miles away, but truly appreciated only by standing in the crater. 
Fort Rock is a prime example of volcanic activity in the Oregon Outback. It was created when basalt magma rose toward the surface and encountered the wet muds of a pluvial (rainwater-sourced) lake bottom. This lake, reaching depths of over 200’, covered most of the Fort Rock and Christmas Valleys, an area between 900 and 1400 square miles. 

The combination of hot magma and the wet lake-bottom created an explosive jet of steam, blowing molten basalt into the air. This fountain of hot lava particles and frothy ash flung itself high into the air, with the pieces and blobs of hot lava and ash then raining back down around the vent and forming a saucer-shaped ring of volcanic ash sitting like an island in the lake waters. As a result of heat and pressure, this ring gradually hardened to its current brick-like form. Inside the ring of tuff, trapped waters made up a lake within a lake. 

The prevailing southwest winds blew across the broad expanse of surrounding water, beating the waves against the external walls of the ring. In time, the wall on that side of the ring was worn down, opening the crater and allowing the trapped water to escape the rocky ring.

As long as the lake waters surrounded the tuff ring, waves buffetted the outer walls, marking them with wave terraces that show current visitors the evidences of the receding water levels. As climate changed through the centuries, the lake evaporated, leaving the high desert as we find it today.

The level of the crater floor inside the ring was much the same as it had originally been, earning the new formation the definition of a Tuff Ring. A Maar would be formed in the same manner, but the resulting crater floor would be lower than the original ground level. Hole-in-the-Ground is an example of this. Table Rock, another geologic feature in this Outback, is classified as a Tuff Cone, which really is a Tuff Ring on steroids (higher palisade-like sides).  All three features, the maar, tuff ring and tuff cone result from volcanic activity mixed with water, either abundant ground or surface water. The same volcanic activity, minus the water, will produce cinder cones or lava flow.


To claim this cache, these requirements must be met:
1.	Examine the outer walls carefully, looking for wave terraces formed by the pounding waves of the lake.
a.	Email us the number of major water levels you note, evidenced by the wave terraces. Do not include this in your log—the log will be deleted.
2.	Post a photo including your group, your GPS and enough of Ft.Rock to be recognizable.
3.	Email us the name of the person who donated the land to the State of Oregon for this park. (Same song,  3rd verse)</groundspeak:long_description>

bonus. The smiley is about one mile across (approximately 3.14
miles in circumfrence).&lt;br /&gt;
This series starts along an existing road, but cross-country travel
is needed from there.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The caches range in size from small Tupperware containers to 50mm
ammo cans. Be on the lookout for anything! They are all full of
swag and there are unactivated coins for FTF in some of them.&lt;br /&gt;
You will want to strategically plan where you start so you have a
chance at one of the first to find prizes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rumor has it that the Easter Bunny may have showed up to leave an
egg or two along the way!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember to save the color and n umber from the lid/log book from
each cache, it's your key to the bonus. Make sure you bring paper
and a pencil to keep track of your numbers.&lt;br /&gt;
Have fun and please rehide well!&lt;br /&gt;

It's a great series, with lots of hiking, interesting landscapes, and delightful, swag-filled caches.  We especially appreciated the ammo cans!  Thank you for placing them!!

Bottom of the container is cracked.  Took orange gem and left a blue one.  TFTC!!</groundspeak:text>

Well, here is your chance!&lt;br /&gt;
This chache series was modeled after one by &lt;a href=

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This Smiley series has 23 caches and 1
bonus. The smiley is about one mile across (approximately 3.14
miles in circumfrence).&lt;br /&gt;
This series starts along an existing road, but cross-country travel
is needed from there.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The caches range in size from small Tupperware containers to 50mm
ammo cans. Be on the lookout for anything! They are all full of
swag and there are unactivated coins for FTF in some of them.&lt;br /&gt;
You will want to strategically plan where you start so you have a
chance at one of the first to find prizes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rumor has it that the Easter Bunny may have showed up to leave an
egg or two along the way!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember to save the color and n umber from the lid/log book from
each cache, it's your key to the bonus. Make sure you bring paper
and a pencil to keep track of your numbers.&lt;br /&gt;
Have fun and please rehide well!&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache is in a small ammo box that is well hidden and the original contents were:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log book, pencils, and sharpener.
&lt;li&gt;Deck of cards
&lt;li&gt;Tape measure
&lt;li&gt;Two rubber balls
&lt;li&gt;Dinosaur
&lt;li&gt;Two plastic clamps
&lt;li&gt;Screw driver set.&lt;/ul&gt;
  
This cache is located a short distance from the old original road from Bend to Burns which went south around Horse Ridge but to locate the cache you will need to do some math and find two U.S. Coast &amp; Geodetic Benchmarks along the road first.
&lt;P&gt;
The first benchmark is at N43° 53.029’ and W 121°05.051’  Stamped in the center of the benchmark’s brass cap is the date the benchmark was set and the benchmark’s identifier code.  To find the second benchmark’s location make the following calculations.
&lt;P&gt;
N 43° 55.XXX’  where XXX = The date divided by 2 and then subtract 108.&lt;br&gt;
W 121° 06.YYY’ where YYY = The two numeric digits in the identifier code multiplied by 5 and then add 6.
&lt;P&gt;
The same type of information is stamped on the second benchmark.  To find the location of the cache make the following calculations.
&lt;P&gt;
N 43° 58.AAA’ where AAA = Subtract 72 from the three numeric digits in the identifier code and then divide by 2.&lt;br&gt;
W 121° 06.BBB where BBB = Subtract 3 from the date then divide by 4 and add 8.
&lt;P&gt;
Good luck and have fun.


While you are working to find this cache you could also get a second cache. Check http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.asp?ID=11656 for details.

I knew I was in the wrong place because, after all, this is a Volcanoguy cache and he loves rocks.  Back to the drawing board and doing the math over and found it today, in a neat rock formation like I knew it would be.  Cold and foggy out this morn, great day for a hike.</groundspeak:text>

started with bessie #6 and worked my way up also climbing a couple of buttes for 3 additional caches. mt. molly and mt. samantha were pretty easy with slopes not too bad and little brush to contend with. swampy butte i went straight up the north side which is steep and a lot of down trees plus brush. took my time so it wasn't too bad. found a more open way to come down a little to the west.

finished up the bessie part and then came down the swampy series making a big loop of things. nobody out and the temps stayed cool. been a while since i have been in some of that country.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Today looked like a perfect day for a 10 and a quarter mile paddle down the Little Deschutes River.  Sun and clouds with little to no wind made for a great day.  Found all 14 new caches in good shape.  Didn't run into any other people on the river, just a few ducks and a couple of fishermen.  Coords were pretty good, just looked for one of those "at arms length" for quite a while before feeling it.  Had thought about stopping here for my first time out this year, but only took hour and a half to get this far so decided  to keep on paddlin'.  Thanks for putting these new river caches out.  Needed to get back in the kayak, always enjoy finding caches with it.  T4TH</groundspeak:text>

Remember to save the color and n umber from the lid/log book from
each cache, it's your key to the bonus. Make sure you bring paper
and a pencil to keep track of your numbers.&lt;br /&gt;
Have fun and please rehide well!&lt;br /&gt;

egg or two along the way!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember to save the color and n umber from the lid/log book from
each cache, it's your key to the bonus. Make sure you bring paper
and a pencil to keep track of your numbers.&lt;br /&gt;
Have fun and please rehide well!&lt;br /&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We planned a Bend area caching get-away. We had watched the Oregon Biggest Smilie since we began caching. It was only fitting to have it be our first geo-art completed! Thanks for the fun time tromping around in the high desert. We completed the circuit in 4.5 hours. Thanks!!</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We are visiting from california.  We came out today to do the whole smiley series, and except for one hitch, we got it done!  It's a great series, with lots of hiking, interesting landscapes, and delightful, swag-filled caches.  We especially appreciated the ammo cans!  Thank you for placing them!!

Took us a few minutes to find this one.  Good size!  Made several swag trades.  TFTC!!</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Last time here Ornith and I managed to collect the necessary numbers from all of the smilie. All that is except this one. Today I was able to correct that omission. It was a cool and dry while I was out walking/hiking through the countryside which made for a nice visit. Last time we met a couple of guys out target shooting but today the area was mine and mine alone. Got the find, got the numbers and headed off to find the bonus.</groundspeak:text>
