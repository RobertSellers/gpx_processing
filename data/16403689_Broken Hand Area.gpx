      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">This Earthcahe is located at Three Creeks Lake. The lake is located in a glacial cirque, below Tam McArthur Rim, which was probably last occupied by glacial ice about 13,000 years ago during the Canyon Creek advance of the Cabot Creek glaciation. The outlet stream from the lake flows northward and is joined by two other streams to form Three Creek. The lake is surrounded by old growth forest,
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A cirque is a landform found among mountains as a result of alpine glaciers. They may be up to a square kilometer in size, situated high on a mountainside near the firn line, and typically are partially surrounded on three sides by steep cliffs. The highest cliff often is called a headwall. The fourth side is the lip, threshold or sill, the side at which the glacier flowed away from the cirque. Many glacial cirques contain tarns dammed by either till (debris) or a bedrock threshold. When enough snow accumulates it can flow out the opening of the bowl and form valley glaciers which may be several kilometers long.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tam McArthur Rim marks the edge of an intriguing, sparsely vegetated, high volcanic tableland. Tam McArthur Rim is protected by the Three Sisters Wilderness Area.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These coordinates will bring you to an information sign where you will learn a bit about the area and a bit about the man the Rim was named after.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To claim this Earthcache. Email me the answers to the following questions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. How much shoreline does Three Creeks Lake have before it reaches the cliffs?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. On the Informational sign, you will learn a bit about Tam McArthur, the volunteer assistant who promoted the mapping of Oregon, the placing of bench marks, the running of level lines and the collection of _________.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. Facing the rim from your position at the sign, describe the lava that you see. Is it rough or smooth? Was it worn away by the glacier or deposited there by an eruption after the glacier came through? Explain your reasoning.

I was surprised to see so many people so high in the mountains. The sun was so bright that I could not clearly see where the shoreline meets the cliffs. I therefore walked along the shore till I reached the cliffs. This is my earthcache #300. Thanks for this wonderful cache!</groundspeak:text>

You will be taking the trail that goes around the lake so enjoy the scenery as you make the trip. Saw people catching fish in the lake while we were there so maybe a little fishing while you are there. There is also a nice hike into Little Three Creeks Lake close by. </groundspeak:short_description>

At setting it contained a poncho, mini 1st aid kit,bungee chord, small binocular, pen, whistle/compass, key chain measuring tape, lotions, pencile sharpner, hand wash, and a small toy car and of course the log.
This area is not available to auto access in the winter time. Snowmobile maybe but you would still have some walking (snowshoeing)to do.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Incredibly challenging?  Devastatingly complex?  Nah.  This cache is simply a way to lure you to two of my favorite quick getaways. Three Creeks Lake, if you haven't been there, is a small jewel of a Cascades Lake.  Great place for a family outing, complete with rentable row boats, and stocked with trout.  This cache is a gateway cache, a 2.5 mile round trip hike from the adjacent trailhead will take you to Uprooted, located at an even more interesting lake, also suitable for kids.  Enjoy!</groundspeak:long_description>

The lake was packed with visitors (PACKED!!).  There are several trees blown down in the GZ area and evidence that someone had to make an emergency bathroom "pit stop".  Looks like we should have visited this cache once the area was reopened, rather than waiting 3 years.  BaileyBellaBC</groundspeak:text>

We each got a beautiful necklace for us to remember our day- they were all so nice it was hard to choose. We left 3 plastic dinosaurs and dropped off a bug that I got from a cache of yours last week. Thanks again- we will really treasure the gifts. I think it was the nicest SWAG I've ever gotten. I also think it was smart to make this a ? as there probably doesn't need to be a cache way up there.

We highly recommend that you hike the full trail all the way back from Camp Sherman down to Shevlin Park to gain the full experience we had hiding this series. If long overnight hikes aren't for you, you can also drive some of the backroads to reach this cache, although walking up/down the trail is still required.

Happy Caching!</groundspeak:long_description>

From here back to home on the west side of Bend is 19 miles and 45 minutes of travel time.  4601 was blocked by a downed snag a couple 100 feet west of where we scampered to grab the cache.  Next time we bring a saw or perhaps one of the many wood cutters will eventually extend access up to 370.  BaileyBellaBC</groundspeak:text>

A steady uphill 2-mile stroll or pedal past a half-dozen waterfalls of all sizes starting with 97-foot Tumalo Falls. Continue for a nice 9.5-mile loop and the &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=3019201f-964a-48e7-9003-773b5a9927ac"&gt;Farewell Trail&lt;/a&gt; cache. Other potential starting points and loop options, including much longer ones, if you want more exercise.
&lt;p&gt;If you bike the loop go clockwise (uphill to the cache and downhill back on the Farewell Trail) to avoid conflicts with hikers. If walking you can go either direction. Dogs on leash or voice command. Small trade items.&lt;/p&gt;

Park at the Upper Three Creek Lake Sno-Park, a Snow Park Permit is required. (The only permit I buy)
You can ski or snowshoe in.It's a five mile round trip. However the snow conditions today allowed me to hike in and just carry my snowshoes. It took an hour to get to the cache. 
Remember to come prepared for any weather and quick changes in it.
Enjoy the view of the mountains.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">The forest road that brings you near the cache is only maintained for high clearance vehicles.  Please note that the coordinates are not those of the cache.  Read the longer description below or you will not find the Gateway to Broken Top.  Enjoy the splendid views.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">You will need to consult a map, such as the excellent Geo-Graphics map of the Three Sisters Wilderness or the “Broken Top” USGS quad map (based on photographs taken in 1959, but with the UTM grid).  The one lane road to the trail head at 7,250 feet is a shock tester (OK, guys, hence the 4 star terrain rating), so figure an hour or more from the highway.  Park your high clearance rig, sign in for a hike and set off down the trail.  Note that the elevation of your destination is 7,172 feet, that will keep you straight.

The coordinates will take you to a point.  Along the "baseline" of the trail, you will spot an almost buried bolder at the edge.  From this point go back up the trail about 14 good paces (mine, not those of Little Max).  Use your compass to take a bearing of 001 degrees (True).  Spot a prominent snag.  Now, look around and find a way to get to that snag that will Leave-No-Trace.  There are several short routes within 50 or 100 feet.

The cache is about 6 paces at a bearing of 180 degrees (True) from the snag.  Again, please Leave-No-Trace of your find.  The cache should be easy to spot.  You have come to far, not to log this one.

Gateway to Broken Top contains a lizard, a beetle, a Maxim stainless steel pocket knife for your Ten Essentials, a string of blue beads, a brass military button, 2 golf balls (yellow), a new wrist watch, a blue Brinkman mini flashlight that needs some TLC that came from Evac, two pet rocks (blond and brunette), no trail fees stickers (2), official mosquito trap from Alaska, a yellow clip, an EMS/SAR accident report form, a new yellow poncho (that was to big for Tiny), and the requisite log (uh, with pencil or pen??) and the official Geocaching info form.

Little Max and I actually placed this cache during an overnight backpacking trip to the glacial tarn on the north side of Broken Top.  For more info on this trip see my personal website.

After we got Charlie and looked at the remains of his cabin we walked over to this cache. We jumped thorough all the hoops and Lynn found the cache right away. A true Eagle eye;)

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I placed this cache near a spring called Bear Wallow Spring. Bear
Wallow Butte is close by also.&lt;br /&gt;
At this time, roads are still snowed in and I placed it while
snomobiling to a tower site where I work often. I have hiked into
the spring many times in the summer and have not seen any Bears.
Cache is placed at the end of a road, off 4602-250 and the spring
is about 1/4 to 1/3 mile from cache, which is placed at a parking
area. You should look at the maps of the area before heading out if
you are not familiar with the area.</groundspeak:long_description>

Charlie George was a trapper who plied his trade in the Cascades of Central Oregon.  In Jan of 1925 Charlie left his home on Tumalo Creek to check his trap line.  He had four cabins that he used on his line.  The first one was located near the "Big Slide" above Tumalo Creek.  His second was at Crater Ditch, the third near Sparks Lake and the last was at Elk Lake.
He never made it to his second cabin.
In late Feb of 1925 a search party made up off some trapper friends attempted a search without results.  Contrary to the plaque at the grave site his remains weren't found until 1929.  His remains were found near the Crater Ditch cabin and buried at this site.
The remains of the cabin are located close by at;
44  03.158
121 41.034
The only items left are some of the base logs and pieces of mortar used in the foundation and log chinking.
To get to this area drive past Todd Lake on the 370 road.  Past Todd Lake the road can be rough so a high clearance vehicle is a good idea.  Turn at the 380 road towards the Broken Top Crater Trailhead.  Just before the actual trailhead there is a spur road with a cable across it.  Park near here but do not block the road.  The grave site is less than a half mile through the woods.

To get credit for this cache, e-mail me with Charlie's age when he left for his last trip.  (Available on the plaque)

This is a great area for hiking via trail or cross country.

I hope you enjoy this little known bit of Central Oregon history.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Out with Bend Cache Collectors for a great hike in the wilderness. Started out on the trail and with the urging of John decided to hang a hard right and bushwhack straight to the cache which was only .6 miles away. Got within 245' when we ran into the stream ;). Jean suggested taking our clothes off and swimming across but leveler heads decided to find a place to rock hop. 

This cache has not been found in a very long time. The history is amazing and the plaque, how cool is that, made of iron, welded lettering, and old railroad rail. This is not going anywhere for a very long time. 

Geocaching the world one cache at a time:

Cache is in a camo instant coffee jar. Elevation at snow gate on the 16 rd ( three creek lake road) where I parked is around 5100&amp;#39;.The shelter is at about 5800&amp;#39;. Just folow the 700 rd up to the cache and up to the shelter if you want the hike. I did not back track and my round trip was about 5 miles. The find could be tough with an accumulation of snow.&lt;/p&gt;

You will want a four x four, or shanks mare, to get in here but at least high clearance will be needed. The road up has a lot of loose rock on it.

Access road starts at: N 44:08.842  X  W 121:34.857

Your looking for another 6 quart plastic box painted green with the normal stuff in it. 

I believe this butte used to have a fire tower on it but vandals burnt it down a few years ago.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Whychus (Why-Choose) Creek is a locals dream for its unique
springs, scenic views, and recreational opportunities. It flows
from high in the Cascade Mountains through the City of Sisters on
its way to the Deschutes River. The name Whychus was the earliest
recorded name for the river located in an 1855 Pacific Railroad
Reports. The name is derived from the Sahaptin language meaning:
“The place we cross the water”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whychus Creek starts with a trio of waterfalls. The trail itself
meanders through a pleasant mixture of lodgepole pines and fir
trees. Around 1.5 miles, the trail switches back gently up a
gradual hill which passes three waterfalls: Lower Chush, Middle
Chush, and Upper Chush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many different types of waterfalls, for the purposes
of this Earthcache we will stick to some of the more traditional
waterfall classifications. A waterfall is a course of water that
drops vertically. This means that it flows over the edge of a cliff
or down a slope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classification of a waterfall is based upon how the water
moves through its course, how much water is flowing, what the
surface beneath the water is and the various geologic processes
that worked to create it. So what was the geologic setting that
helped create this area?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The headwaters of this creek come from seven remnant ice age
glaciers within the Three Sisters Wilderness area. The creek is
created by glacier melt and is about 45 miles in length and drops
8000 feet over its journey. Due to the unique hydrology and geology
of the volcanic area, 89% of the water flows as groundwater under
the creek to emerge as springs downstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first waterfall you'll encounter along Whychus Creek is
referred to as Lower Chush Falls. Early settlers referred to the
creek as Squaw Creek. (The term "Squaw" is offensive to many Native
Americans, and Oregon law required the creek to be renamed). Off to
the right of the overlook, is a steep trail that will take you down
to the falls. Lower Chush Falls is the only one of nine waterfalls
officially deemed accessible by the forest service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second waterfall along Whychus Creek is not named, but to
the locals is known as the "Middle" falls. The third waterfall
along Whychus Creek is referred to as Upper Chush falls. The trail
to the Upper falls is a user maintained trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formation of a waterfall occurs when a river flows over a
large step in the rocks which may have been formed by a fault line.
Over a period of years, the edges of this shelf will gradually
break away and the waterfall will steadily retreat upstream,
creating a gorge of recession. Often, the rock stratum just below
the more resistant shelf will be of a softer type, meaning
undercutting, due to splashback, will occur here to form a shallow
cave-like formation known as a rock shelter or plunge pool under
and behind the waterfall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streams become wider and shallower just above waterfalls due to
flowing over the rock shelf, and there is usually a deep pool just
below the waterfall because of the kinetic energy of the water
hitting the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;There are many types of waterfalls, and for this Earthcache,
you will need to identify each of the three falls.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Block:&lt;/b&gt; Water descends from a relatively wide stream or
river and drops over a ledge forming what appears to be a "sheet"
of water. Ideally, it is observably wider than it is tall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cascade :&lt;/b&gt; Water descends a series of rock steps. There
may be separate waterfalls falling consecutively and in close
proximity so generally they can be seen together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chute :&lt;/b&gt; A violent section of water that is forced through
a narrow passage due to cliff walls or large rocks. Depending on
the descent angle, they may be classified as rapids not a
waterfall. Very common in canyons where the water is
wall-to-wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fan :&lt;/b&gt; Water falls through a relatively narrow crest and
spreads out and becomes wider as it descends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Horsetail :&lt;/b&gt; Descending water maintains some contact with
bedrock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Plunge:&lt;/b&gt; Water descends vertically, losing contact with
the bedrock surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Punchbowl :&lt;/b&gt; Water falls through a constricted area and
descends down into a pool of water. The water "punches" through and
falls into a "bowl".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parallel:&lt;/b&gt; When falls are side-by-side and fall similar to
each other. There can be two or more falls and can be from the same
watercourse or from more than one watercourse. Twin falls are also
side-by-side but do not have to be similar in type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ribbon:&lt;/b&gt; Water descends in a narrow strip significantly
taller than it is wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Talus :&lt;/b&gt; Water flowing over a chaotic mix (30 degree slope
or greater) of rock debris on a slope usually found at the base of
a cliff or steep incline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Veil :&lt;/b&gt; Water falls over rocks (usually large rocks)
creating a thin layer of water that just barely covers its
surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;To log this cache, you will need to do the following.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;1) Determine which type of waterfall you are looking at with
each of the falls. Please email your answers to the owner of this
Earthcache, and DO NOT include the answers in the log.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;2) Take a photo of you and your GPS with the Upper Chush
waterfall in the background and post it with your log.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Note about waterfalls: When a scientist identifies a waterfall,
they do so at it's most prominent form. When you are viewing these
falls, they may look different depending on the time of year. Make
an educated guess, and I'll help you out if needed!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Directions: Depending on where you are coming from, you will
need to get onto the McKenzie Highway. This is the old road that
will take you over the McKenzie Pass. Once you pass the Middle and
High School, you will see a sign for Pole Creek and Whychus Creek.
Turn left onto this road, which is Forest Road 15. This road will
be paved for the first two miles of your trip, and then will become
a gravel road. Continue on the main road until you see a sign for
Whychus Creek (5.3 miles from the McKenzie Highway), and take a
left here. Follow this road until you cross the bridge. Right after
the bridge, take a right, and follow the road for three miles. The
road can be a little rough for about a mile. If you are coming here
in a small vehicle, please drive slowly!&lt;/p&gt;

After the big fire of 2012 things have changed and the cache description is no longer quite up-to-date. The trail head was moved back by almost a mile and I had to hike 9.5 km (almost 6 miles) to get to the cache and back. The trail is easy and well maintained except for the short and steep trail down to the Lower Falls. Thanks for this spectacular earthcache!</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We had a fantastic day out there today hiking around. We made it to all three falls and stopped for a snack at the upper falls while sitting on a log watching. We pretty much had the place to ourselves. There was a forest service truck at the trailhead, but no sign of the employee. The way in has changed considerably from the description of getting there in the 100 Cascades hikes book. You have to park over a mile from the trailhead listed in the book. The roads are blocked off.  I will post a photo as soon as I get them off the camera. I have to dig out the USB cord from the back of the jeep. Thanks for getting me up there. I had no idea about the falls.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We picked a great day to do this hike, had no idea the tiny puff of smoke in the distance would quickly turn into a wildfire in the next canyon over, Pole Creek. On the way back down the trail, the fire looked huge, and driving out on the primitive road, we could see flames on the ridge across Whychus Creek. I hope the restoration work they've done on the creek isn't ruined. 

Once we made it to the main road 1514 or whatever, a Forest Service employee came flying by in his truck, apparently sweeping the area for hikers and campers. We had pulled over to take some photos, so he probably thought we were crazy. He told us to head toward Three Creek Road because the road we came in on was blocked. What an adventure, we went to the brew-pub immediately, to calm our nerves.

Wonderful hike, we loved this cache!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Easy to find ammo box near a steep trail above Tumalo Falls. Nice views of the Bridge Creek and North Fork Tumalo Creek drainages and the Cascades. Initial contents are mostly for mountain bikers.
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The trail:&lt;/b&gt; The Farewell Trail is a relatively new mountain bike single-track connecting the Tumalo Falls trailheads with the Mrazek Trial to the north. It provides a way for cyclists to complete a 9.5-mile loop combined with the beautiful North Fork Trail (one-way uphill for cyclists). To reach just the cache via the Farewell Trail, you are looking at 600' of elevation gain and a mile to the cache, which is why this is recommended as the downhill leg when cycling. Fun hike in either direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Getting there:&lt;/b&gt; The southern trailhead is at N 44°01.910' W 121°33.873' just before the Tumalo Falls parking lot, a Forest Fee area. If driving, go west out of Bend on Skyliner Road to its end where it turns right across Tumalo Creek. After the bridge, take a left at the fork on a gravel road to the Tumalo Falls parking lot. There are several ways to bicycle there; get a map available at bike shops or the Forest Service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Further adventures:&lt;/b&gt; After the cache, you can return the way you came or continue on many miles of trails, including a splendid 12-mile plus run down into Shevlin Park.&lt;/p&gt;

Geez....sure is a lot of snow up here on the bike trail and looks like 3-4 bikes have tried their luck after the recent snowfall.  Plenty of mushrooms were evident, but we did not gather.

Parked at the east end of Big Meadow after turning around short of the two huge mud holes up near the now archived view cache, then hoofed on over.  We remember when our parking area at Big Meadow was a very popular mtn. bike trailhead...not today...much of the trail to the new main trail is missing.  Given that the next two weeks will be warm and sunny, perhaps 370 will dry out.  Coords for this cache were Spot-On.  Thanks for the FTF and the fun today.  Bailey and Bella Bella had a blast as well.  BaileyBellaBC</groundspeak:text>

The cache is a small green ammo box.  Trade items should be limited to travel bugs and/or geocoins although your visit and signing the log is encouraged.  If you would like to leave something other than a travel bug or geocoin that is welcome.  Just make sure you trade for like items.  The cache has started out with three travel bugs.

You can park approximately 0.15 miles from the cache but after that the chosen route is up to you.  Yes, it is steep, brushy and there are numerous locations to hide a cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Came straight up the hill from my TODD LAKE CACHE. I had to fix it. What a cardio/quad workout! Popped up on the top rim right by a little rock cairn (yours?) about 350 feet from the cache. This cache was a true pleasure to get. Pardon my French but screw all the little micro's 500 feet apart. I like the ones that are a challenge and that are memorable. I will remember this one. I have 4000+ caches and this container is in the top ten or five that I have found. Kudos to you on the spot and the cache. This Caballo Blanco cache gets a big FAVORITE from I. Walked the top east until I hit the trail while flushing out a nice 5x5 buck twice. he was sure annoyed with me. Thanks for the fun. T-TB.</groundspeak:text>

Hoofed overland through the occasional and then steady carpet of snow, 6-12 inches, post-holing in places.  We had parked at the east side of Big Meadow, after turning back at the HUGE 2 mud holes a tad short of the view cache that is ailing.  Incredibly, some rigs had been driven through the meadow next to the mud holes, so now there is quite a mess up there on this fragile turf.  Hoofed over to #3 and then down to this #2, for about 3-4 good miles overland.  This was Bella Bella's first off-leash romp in the forest and she was thrilled with the experience.  

Had nearly given up after searching for 30 minutes.  Lady Kestrel spotted a likely hiding spot some 84 feet east of GZ and sure enough, there was the cache, alongside the trail and hanging amongst a cluster of tall ones.  10T 0607357E, 4875340N  BaileyBellaBC</groundspeak:text>

Take your time, enjoy the views, pay attention to your path, and some potential hazards like brush, rolling rocks, and did I say brush.  Oh yeah, there is some brush.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">After placing this cache I thought it should be named "Snowbrush I" but depending on your route of travel you will encounter your fair share of Manzanita also.

The cache is a cammo ammo can.  The placement of it wasn't my first choice but as I had a hard time getting good reception I settled for this spot.  I think when you get to the cache you will see where I would have preferred to put it.  After all the work just getting here the cache is pretty easy to find.

The most obvious parking spot is at N44*02.060, W121*32.651.  From this spot you will have approximately 0.26 miles to hike if you stay in a straight line (won't happen).  Your elevation gain will be about 650 feet on a slope that averages 53% although it gets much steeper the higher you get.  

Be careful, don't take little kids, watch for rolling rocks, enjoy the brush and savor the view.  This is ideal cat habitat so you might want to be packing.  Nobody is going to get here in 15 minutes.</groundspeak:long_description>

Reversed the order and dropped down from Larsen's Log (wow, that would be a "burn" hiking-up!). Nice spot, enjoyed the swag, left some nice trinkets. Strolled on over to the lake; LOT's of little frogs - the kids were delighted!  t4th sl</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Best to park at wide spot near radio tower and walk in.  The brush has really overgrown the roadway.  My paint job is not that good but sounds terrible when it scrapes the side of rig.  I had to hold my wife's hand on portions the the last 200 feet.  She does not like steep slopes.  We both made it.  It is a nice view down the canyon, you can see Skyliners Lodge and the areas thinning by the USFS over the past few years.  The USFS is undertaking a massive fuels reduction in the area to make it easier to protect the homes in the area when the next wild fire comes.  The Bridge Creek burn was in 1979 and the brush is ripe for an other fire.  This would be a great spot to spend an evening and watch the stars on a clear moon less night.

Nice hike from down below, we though
the road might be to narrow to drive, then 
we ran into a Jeep and the folk were from Texas
and they wonder if they were close to Dallas.
I don't think they were Geocaching.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">We parked at N44*02.030, W121*40.621 on 370 for a 30 minute hike to the cache over gentle terrain, traveling on the old access trail to the Green Lakes Trail.  Another cache is nearby this old trail.  There are also several good approaches from Todd Lake Trailhead, either by the Green Lakes Trail or the lakeside trail from the west side of the lake.

Some cross-country travel is required from any approach and the hiking trail to Green Lakes from Todd Lake will take about as much time as driving up 370 to the listed waypoint and hiking on from there.  Either of these two approaches takes you very close to another recent cache.  Springs and meadows abound, and also enjoy the sound of Soda Creek waterfalls far below.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is near to a beautiful mountain lake.   After finding the cache, take some time to explore or hike around the lake.  The views are fantastic!   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:  This cache container has already survived a winter out in the wild.  While placing it at a nearby location last summer, we heard a bad car accident and dropped everything to go help, forgetting about the cache.  Fortunately, even though there were injuries, both the people and pets survived.  &lt;img alt="smiley" src="http://www.geocaching.com/static/js/CKEditor/4.4.0/plugins/smiley/images/regular_smile.png" title="smiley" style="height:23px;width:23px;" /&gt;    In the aftermath, we never did get it published.  So today, we finally retrieved it and made a new placement.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give someone a hug, a Teddy Bear, or both today! &lt;img alt="heart" src="http://www.geocaching.com/static/js/CKEditor/4.4.0/plugins/smiley/images/heart.png" title="heart" style="height:23px;width:23px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Whychus (Why-Choose) Creek is a locals dream for its unique springs, scenic views, and recreational opportunities. It flows from high in the Cascade Mountains through the City of Sisters on its way to the Deschutes River. 

The headwaters of this creek comes from seven remnant ice age glaciers within the Three Sisters Wilderness area. The creek is created by glacier melt and is about 45 miles in length and drops 8000 feet over its journey. Due to the unique hydrology and geology of the volcanic area, 89% of the water flows as groundwater under the creek to emerge as springs downstream.

Along the river, the Forest Service has created fairly rustic campsites for people to enjoy. Please use these areas if you are camping in this area, and remember to leave the site cleaner than you found it.

The cache is located up on top of this viewpoint.  From here, you can see the roaring waters below and the Upper Chush Falls in the distance.  

Be very careful accessing this cache.  This place may be unsuitable for dogs and little kids.

Directions: Depending on where you are coming from, you will need to get onto the McKenzie Highway. This is the old road that will take you over the McKenzie Pass. Once you pass the Middle and High School, you will see a sign for Pole Creek and Whychus Creek. Turn left onto this road, which is Forest Road 15. This road will be paved for these first two miles of your trip, and then will become a gravel road. Continue on the main road until you see a sign for Whychus Creek (5.3 miles from the McKenzie Highway), and take a left here. Follow this road until you get close to the cache. Park in the campground, and enjoy your time!

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">The cache is not located at the posted coordinates.  You need to visit two waypoints to locate the final cache.  Do not attempt with snow on the ground.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The posted coordinates are within the Three Sisters Wilderness, setup to help you locate the cache which is outside the Wilderness.  At the two waypoints cited below, you will find interesting views and physical clues to locating the final cache.  The cache is located at N44*01.XYZ, W121*41.PQR.   Solve this puzzle cache by visiting the two waypoints and getting values for the letters X, Y, Z, P, Q, R.

WP1:  See the several (dead) snags with multiple trunks atop the several single snag trunks.  By definition herein, if you locate one main trunk attached to the ground, with 4 dead trees atop, you have one snag trunk and 4 tree trunks atop.  Total trunks would be (1+4) or 5 trunks.

Do not count the nearby LIVE trunks with multiple trees atop! 
 
At the first Waypoint:  Z  = [(snag trunks attached to the ground + total dead trees atop) - 4]
R = (snag trunks attached to the ground - 1)


WP2: Q = (total trunks + tree tops of WP1) + Root Wads w/rocks - 3
Y = root wad w/rocks + Lodge Pole Pine w/red needles on the cliff (ready for the plunge) + tree tops of WP1 - 4
X =[tree tops of WP1 - Root Wad w/rocks of WP2 + number of tall (standing) snags at WP2 with base diameter of one foot or more]  - 1
P = [number of tall snags of WP2 with base diameter of one foot or more + root wads w/rocks + trunks at WP1 attached to ground]    Divide this figure by 3 for "P"

(Look carefully down the face of this cliff and notice the small trees and trees bearing scars on their bark.  Winter snows accumulate on the cliff topside and avalanche down this gully, into the hemlock forest below.)
Checksum: sum of all objects you have counted = 12

Additional Waypoints
B01YJE2 - Parking
N 44° 02.120 W 121° 40.545
Park here off the 370 Road on the turnout or hike up the Green Lakes Trail from Todd Lake.  This start point will save you about 200 vertical gain and allow ready access to two nearby caches in route to WP1 and WP2.  The cache is somewhere down there in the Todd Lake Basin, so eventually you will return to the lake and your search.  Best plan for 2 hrs to complete this cache, so do take a lunch, water and your camera.
B11YJE2 - View1
N 44° 01.920 W 121° 41.864
count number of trunks attached to the ground and total number of trees atop these dead trunks
B21YJE2 - View2
N 44° 02.000 W 121° 41.982
Count the number of root wads with roots surrounding large rock or rocks; Count the number of tall snags with base diameter 1 ft or more; Count the number of Lodge Pole Pines (red needles) ready to take the plunge from the cliff, or have fallen from the cliff.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Good Day,

It looks like your cache has been under the weather for some time. While I feel that Geocaching.com should hold the location for you and block other cachers from entering the area around this cache for a reasonable amount of time, we can't do so forever. Please either repair/replace this cache in the next couple of weeks, or archive it so that someone else can place a cache in the area, and cachers can once again enjoy visiting this location.

If the reason the cache is under the weather is something out of your control, such as construction or flooding, please post a note on the cache page with your best guess of when the conditions will improve. If the situation is temporary and is something out of your control, there is no need to archive the cache at this time.

I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to geocaching in the past and am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the future.

Thanks for your understanding - Cheers!

The final hide area has a lot of limbs, sticks and bark debris and makes for a really hard find. Plus, with the changes in the waypoints, it could use a little bit of a redo.

Now that I am home, I think I am going to work on it again to see if I get a slightly different answer, because I felt like I was pretty close, but the hint and my location weren't quite right. I may have to email for a little help though if my figures don't change.  The views were great though and the hike around the Todd Lake Ridge was great.

Had the brilliant  idea to try using a stick, which broke. Went to #2. 45 min later, no luck. Tried to go to #3 , thought I didn't have time, turned around, spent 20 more min at #2, kept going, but in another solid effort at #1.  So, I never signed the log, and didn't do much else other than enjoy the nice weather and wonderful bike ride . I'll count that hill as my workout for the day.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">So glad to be out here getting this cache! I would always joke with my parents as we drove by that we should go get it and I knew that wasn’t going to happen with them along so I teamed up with GPS51111 and we headed out to get this cache! Showed her some other caches in the area and then we headed up, that is a nice climb. Really got that I just climbed a mountain feeling when we got to the top. Found the container pretty quickly and set down to the other bear lake cache. The day was gorgeous and sunny; shed my coat on the way up because it was so hot. Was a little saddened when we found trash on the way up… but at least we took it out with us. Also was glad to get to move the travel bug that was in this cache so it didn’t winter in the area. Favorite point from me for taking us to such a cool location and viewpoint!

&lt;p&gt;This small lake is located south of Todd Lake at approximately
6,467 feet. This should be an easy hike and a fun place for the
dogs to swim depending on the time of year.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>

Bare Lake Cliffs&lt;/a&gt; cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found this nice little spot on our return trip from the Bare
Lake Cliffs and Hiker Girl decided it was a much easier route then
the one I chose for the way in. &lt;img src=

&lt;p&gt;Sorry about the container size, it was all I had with me at the
time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably won't need a swim suit, but don't forget your bug
spray and be sure to bring your own pencil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't forget your NW Forest Pass when parking at the Todd Lake

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This one has us scratching our heads and yelling at each other across the lake. Mostly cause GPS51111 wasn’t willing to admit my GPS was right in pointing us towards the cache though she did figure out the hint. I found the container though [:P] I guess that makes it a team effort. Great location and a nice hike down from Bear Lake Cliffs. Had a truly wonderful day out caching, sunny and full of endorphins. Favorite point from me for such a great experience.

A traditional cache where all you have to do is load one set of coordinates then go hike a short distance and find it.  It is even fairly close to town so you bike riders could ride to the starting point.  You are looking for a clear plastic nut jar (Costco) with a red lid.  Size is about a half a gallon.

Remember in college where classes were divided into lower division classes and upper division classes?  Our cache called "Manzanita" is a lower division class and should be a prerequisite for this one.  If you didn't like that one you for sure won't like this one.  Also, this one doesn't have hot pink flagging hanging like a christmas tree to help you locate the cache.

Have fun and take your time.  Wear long pants.  You will have some good views.  Might be a kitty cat in the area.  Can be done in about an hour.

Thank god I am a coastal forester and used to real brush.  The cache is located such as so it should survive the next Bridge Creek Burn.  We had dry lightning today while on the way to the cache.  I knew I was close when I found the empty Coors can.  I did pack it out.  Sorry for the next person who looks for the cache no more beer cans.  It was good to see the fuels reduction from the top the usfs has been doing the past two summers.  The fuels reductions should make the next Bridge Creek Fire easier to control.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Trying to get the required points for GC2R887 - DrAwKwArD's Only the Lonely Challenge cache hunt and sorting through the list for closest caches here in the local area, I found this lonely cache which has been sitting unfound for just shy of 4 years.

Nice cache placement there weenie.

I went in from the bottom  on the east side and then sidehilled up the North face until I was in the tree plantation and across the ridge to the cache.

It was a good day to be out in the tickets seeing as there is still plenty of snow/ice on top of the brush holding it all down so I only had to lop a few bush's to throw on top of the softer snow so as I would not have to posthole much.

It only took about 45 minutes to get to the cache, spent about 15 minutes at the cache and then about half an hour to go West on the road and then drop down through the brush back to the road and walk to the car.

I took nothing from the cache but I did leave a "Lost and Found" Traveler and some drink mix in the cache for the next finder.

I am not sure why this cache is so far and few between finds as it is really an easy location to get to in the summer when you can drive most of the way in or hiking even the road should take no more then an hour from the gravel.  Unless you come in from the Tumalo creek side and try to be foolish and go straight up the front. That would be dumb.

Thanks for a great hunt today.

I think this one score somewhere around 160 points for the challenge.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;You're looking for a glass pickle jar, the jar is black duct taped, and the top has purple duct taped. I was originally going to put this one closer to Sparks Lake, but there is a lot more caches there than i expected, so i thought I'd put it here. Access to the cache might be seasonal, unless you dont mind taking a long snowshoe hike during winter; i think they close off the Cascade Lakes Highway (the road that you'll take just past Mt. Bachlor to get to the cache) from November 1 to March or April (I think, dont quote me on that). So if it is closed, and there is a lot of snow, this cache might not be accessable during winter, it all depends on how deep the snow is at the cache, since the cache is on the ground level. If you do snowshoe in during winter, PLEASE BE SAFE, BE PREPARED. In other times of the year, be careful where you walk, there's a lot of stumps and down branches. PLEASE HIDE CACHE AS YOU FOUND IT (otherwise it will take the fun out for the next cacher, or it might be spotted by non-cachers and stollen).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please let me know if log is down to the last 2 or 3 sheets or if pencils need to be replaced so i can get up there before they run out.&lt;/p&gt;

After signing the log with a pen I brought - the pen in the cache no longer works - we celebrated with a little glass of wine and chocolate square. Note the the sum of our ages is over 130 so this cache, a little lower than the 7780 ft summit of Tumalo Mt., was a real accomplishment. When we got back to town we celebrated again with warm lattes.

Calliopal showed her mountaineering wisdom by wearing just the right clothing and bringing the right gear. Given the icy/crusting conditions, we opted for snowshoes rather than skis.

Though Calliopal hasn't been on all my cache adventures, she's been on most of them and was there for the first one and I am so glad she was there for #800. And not just because she brought the wine and chocolate.</groundspeak:text>

We parked near the OMSI camp.  As you hike/bike or maybe xc ski this one you will come across the Virginia Meissner snow park trail follow it.  These caches will not be too far off the trail.  

The listed coords. will take you to the first cache.  You are looking for a small plastic container.  Inside you will find the coords. to a ammo container.  When you find that cache remember to write down the bonus coords.

We placed this ammo cache and the bonus one in areas close to wonderful views, so take a moment and enjoy.  On your way up please take a moment to stop at N44' 01.818 and     W 121' 31.701 to take it in.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Cache-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is an intermediate orienteering-style hunt using primarily map and compass. Only the beginning and end stages use a GPS receiver. At the first stage you will pick up a map which will show the location of the 8 orienteering stages. At each stage you will gather information to calculate the GPS coordinates of the final cache. The course is around Dutchman Flat, a popular snow area in the winter at over 6000 feet.
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Verdana"&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Overview&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This combination geocaching and orienteering hunt is similar to &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=49aa35ba-935b-42fc-a39d-4e497ffdcb51"&gt;Cache-O (archived)&lt;/a&gt; but in higher alpine terrain with longer stages. You will find 2 caches (the map cache and the final cache with logbook) and 8 control points. Some points are easy to get to, others more difficult. &lt;b&gt;You'll be covering up to 8 miles (13 km), on trail and off.&lt;/b&gt; If you are fast and accurate this might take less than 2 hours, but if you are like me allow at least 4 hours plus lunch. If you want the full orienteering experience, try running the course; you will quickly discover why top-level orienteers are among the best conditioned athletes around!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kids and dogs are welcome on the trails but might find the distance and off-trail sections challenging. There is some volcanic soil which could irritate paws. The hunt is impractical for winter because snow will bury the markers and cache; note the ski trail diamonds 20 feet up the trees! You may also spot a tarp across the meadow in the trees; this is a Forest Service cache of winter signs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Verdana"&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Instructions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Park at the Dutchman Flat Sno-Park (no permit required during the summer season), find the nearby container at the listed coordinates and take a 2-page map. The detailed orienteering map has topographic lines, roads, trails, large boulders, general vegetation, and other things to help you figure out where you are. It also shows the starting point (the map cache) with a red triangle, and the 8 control points you will visit, highlighted by large red circles to indicate the &lt;i&gt;general&lt;/i&gt; location. Lines on the map are oriented to magnetic north.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://imgcdn.geocaching.com/cache/d6721b5f-d476-4237-948b-6586103580ce.jpg" align="right" /&gt;After retrieving a map at the start &lt;i&gt;put away your GPS receiver and plan your trip&lt;/i&gt;. Figure out what order you want to do the points and how best to get to them. The direct route will rarely be best. Use trails to your advantage. Some of the trails you may be on are popular with mountain bikers and horses; others are faint ski trails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Use a compass to project a bearing and count your paces between locations on your route.&lt;/i&gt; (GPS receivers are not allowed in official orienteering events and, in any case, would slow down competitors too much). Follow your position on the map by noting the features you can identify. Near the control point use the hint (on the map) and nearby features to help find the marker. The markers are not hidden but you will need to be close to see them. &lt;b&gt;Write down the number on the marker.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://imgcdn.geocaching.com/cache/large/960ae50d-9b80-4208-9153-97e8100df811.jpg" align="left" /&gt;At each control point, designated by a letter &lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; through &lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;H&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;, is a 4 by 4-inch plastic marker on which is written a letter and number. Use the numbers corresponding to the letters to compute the cache coordinates as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For N 44º &lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;qr.stu&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;, qrstu = (A+B+C+D) x (E+F+G+H) x 2 + 80&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For W 121º &lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;vw.xyz&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;, vwxyz = (E+F+G+H) x (E+F+G+H) x 64 + 5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insert leading zeroes as necessary to get 5 digits; for example, 4321 would become 04321. The final cache is a small ammo can somewhere on the map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Things to bring:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; pencil or pen, compass, short ruler to measure distance on map (many compasses have one), gear for a backcountry day hike, a GPS receiver, and perhaps a calculator (many GPS receivers have one). If you don't know the length of your average pace (a pace is 2 steps, so you count off the same foot), figure it out beforehand; I'm at around 60 paces for 100 m on level ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Verdana"&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Orienteering&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://imgcdn.geocaching.com/cache/large/1a86cbee-7580-46cd-977f-4870c16b4bf3.jpg" align="right" /&gt;Orienteering is a sport that finds markers, called "control points," using a special map, compass, keen observation and careful route selection. The markers are not hidden like in geocaching and there are other differences, but the navigation basics and the fun of finding things outdoors are the same.
&lt;p&gt;Orienteering originated in the Scandinavian military during the 19th century. Sporting competition began in 1919 and gained popularity with the development of good compasses in the 1930s. By the 1960s orienteering went international with its appealing combination of mental and physical challenges, outdoor competition and environmental awareness. Today, 63 national orienteering federations are registered with the International Orienteering Federation which holds an annual world championship. The &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.us.orienteering.org/"&gt;U.S. Orienteering Federation&lt;/a&gt; website has a nice &lt;i&gt;Education&lt;/i&gt; section if you would like to learn more about the sport and navigating by map and compass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traditional event involves cross-country running and is called Foot-O. Like geocache hunts, orienteering event difficulty and terrain vary widely from easy city parks to backcountry conditions. Many variations have evolved from the original such as Bike-O, Ski-O, Trail-O, Canoe-O and, now, Cache-O.&lt;/p&gt;

I am left to wonder what might have happened to this cache.  Is it possible that someone just picked it up and took it home?  Threw it away?  Go figure!</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I started this BadBoy last October with Kiki and promptly got stumped at the second tag.  Came back this year with BrainSmoke who was able to sniff out the second point with ease.  We rolled through the rest of the course throughout the afternoon which was beautiful weatherwise.  After eating lunch at the bridge I forgot to zip my pack so we had to backtrack for awhile picking my wares up along the course.  If you find a Brunton compass, it's your to enjoy.  We did have to remove several limbs from a downed tree that had fallen and was obscuring D.  Best cache yet on my list.  Excellent location and layout.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Headed out again this morning to give this another shot. Determined that all the sourness from our prior attempt was nobody's fault except mine. Woke up the next morning and first thing that popped into my head was the stupid mistake I had made the day before. In doing the measuring and projections to get from point B to C and/or D, I had mixed up the scales of the two maps provided and therefore the projections were in error and we had spent a lot of time looking in the wrong places. Sat down Saturday morning with the maps and made projections to all the remaining waypoints from both A &amp; B and checked the calculations and they were almost identical. Enjoyed the hike to the balance of the waypoints and the final cache today. Hiked a little over 6 miles in 4:30 minutes with time out for lunch. Thought we would be first to find in 2009, but surprisingly, two other cachers had signed the log today before we did. Great job on laying out this cache. Ran into a gentleman that was out tagging areas for a orienteering event in about a month. He was using the same map you are using for this cache. TFTH.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Welcome to Chloe's Butterfly Cache.  Chloe has been geocaching with us since she was 2 and she was ready to place her own.  We helped her design this cache to be beginner friendly.  Not too difficult to find and there is a nice meadow for a picnic.  Together we have caught and identified at least 9 different butterfly species in the meadow, so be sure to bring a net.  There are many grasshoppers and dragonflies too.  Pack along some bug spray as sometimes the mosquitoes come out to play with the butterflies.  Chloe and her little sister love to wade in the stream and look at the shiny rocks.  The cache is just a short way into the wooded area and there are nice paths along the river.  There are some other geocaches nearby if you are wanting to take on more caches while you are out.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Cache is meant to be accessable year around, except during the spring thaw when the trail is mushy.  The nordic trail starts at Swampy Lakes Snow Park and is 7 miles round trip.  It is considered an intermediate trail. Snow Park Permit is required during the ski season. By bike, the trail is accessible from several entry points including Swampy Lakes Snow Park.  Most trailheads require a Northwest Forest Pass.  If you bike in, please avoid coming when the trails are muddy after the spring thaw and leave your bike at the Swede Ridge Warming Shelter (see waypoint) and walk to the cache from there.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We headed up to the shelter today and, since we had found the cache in 2006, decided to check on it because of the previous DNF. I could see the cord disappearing into the snow so I assume the cache is still there. Didn't have a shovel or spare gloves so didn't try to extract it. Beautiful, warm day with spring skiing conditions. We met many people on the trail including a group who spent the night camped near the shelter.</groundspeak:text>

On the way out, I asked my 3 friends to help me look for this cache. Figured it would be easy with 4 people looking, even at night, but no such luck. Really wanted to be the first winter find of this cache in four years. Looked in every thicket, but the trees were carrying a lot of snow and we didn't see any black cord. I'm sure it's still there, but sadly, I don't get out to this shelter too often. Sorry, Goudacat.</groundspeak:text>

Cache is easy to find.  If the gate is closed, the cache is a half mile walk.  If the gate is open, it is about a tenth of a mile.  If you go between the 4th of July and Labor day, you might want to try riding the lift to the Pine Marten Lodge.  Check www.mtbachelor.com for hours of operation and web cam pictures.&lt;P&gt;
Mount Bachelor is aware of the cache but does not endorse the activity.  (Cache at your own risk)

Winter difficulty is a two and summer difficulty is a four. This

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The main coordinates are for one of the parking lots at the ski
area. You must answer the following four questions. The answers are
easy to find by following the coordinates. E-mail me your answers.
If your GPS does travel speed it is interesting to see how fast you
are actual going. Convinced me to buy a helmet. Have fun.&amp;gt;
Question # 1. N 43 59.784 W 121 41.359&lt;br&gt;
How many people are represented on the sign? 
&lt;p&gt;Question # 2. N 43 59.406 W 121 41.196&lt;br&gt;
What year was Bill born?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question # 3. N 43 59.138 W 121 40.354&lt;br&gt;
What is the posted elevation in feet above sea level.&lt;/p&gt;

What is mounted to the south side of a large hemlock tree.&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I have been waiting for just the right day to do this 1.5/5 cache to complete the Fizzy challenge.
I parked near the Sunrise gate and hiked up past a couple of lifts. When I got up near the base of the Summit lift (question #3) I met a skier with 3 dogs. As I came within sight of the answer, along came 3 snowboarders that had started near the summit. The third in line was naked and waved on the way by.
From there I took the groomed path up to the Pine Marten Lodge. I stepped off the trail when a groomer came by. At the lodge I got the answer to question 2 and took a picture with my GPS at the feet of the bronze statue. The elevation up there was 7750'.
From the lodge I hiked down to the hemlock for question 4. From there I hiked across to the run with the answer to question 1. At that point I was moving about 2.7mph with no helmet required.
There was one small area above question 1 where  I postholed a couple of steps but for the most part I has walking without any trouble in top of about 3-4 feet of snow.
Hiking this route took me about 3 hours. I didn't get a picture of the naked snowboarder, but have posted 2 good pictures from my hike.

The thinning has changed the area but cache is still in good shape.  Note the USFS has plans to under burn the area as part of a project to make the Skyliner area more fire safe.  ie make the next wild fire easier to control.

We took a few dog treats for our dog that had to stay home (he was sad) and left an Oregon button.  Amazing views! Lots of good swag in this cache.  Great day!  Thanks!</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I'm trying to do at least one cache a week this year and this one was the first. We snowshoed up from the Vista Butte Sno-Park (pass required), part on-trail and part off, on a sunny and calm day. Roundtrip of 3.4 miles with 785 feet elevation change in 2.5 hours including lunch at the top. 

We tried to do the cache last winter but got bogged down in incredibly deep snow. As it turns out, the cache would have been buried anyway. No such problem this year as there is barely a foot or two in most places and little at the top. Finished up the cache just as a couple of muggle groups showed up. 

Thanks for the nice hide. You could add attributes for bicycles, skis and snowshoes and give winter parking coords (N 43 59.020, W 121 36.385) as the butte is on an established trail system that connects to the trails at Swampy Sno-Park. It's moderately steep approaching the top but is otherwise relatively easy.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">WOW.  FTF today about 1:10.  Your coor. were excellent for us.  When we were looking for caches to do down here, Zircon101 had his interest peaked by several tha appear to be only water accessible.  He emailed the CO and asked if he had any nearby caches that were land accessible, hoping they would be along the lake.  The CO sent us back the information on these Todd Lake-Lava Lake caches that he had just placed.  Hmm.  Not found yet.  I need a FTF for August.  Worth a shot and it worked.

Although this is more a bike trail, it was a beautiful hike.  In Forest Park (Portland), the bike trails run UP and down--none of this meandering stuff!
I quickly learned that the shortest distance between two points for forest bike trails is NOT a straight line.  We probably walked twice as far as the bird flies,  but it was a very nice walk.  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Like glaciers worldwide those in the Cascade Range in Oregon have shrunk substantially as a result of a warming planet and since the end of the Little Ice Age (O'Connor et al. 2001). In areas where glaciers have receded in the Cascades hundreds of lakes have formed. Most are in stable basins, but about 30 are dammed by unconsolidated moraines that are susceptible to failure. The highest concenration of these lakes that have dams susceptible to failure in the United States are in the Mount Jefferson and Three Sisters Wilderness Area in central Oregon. In this area there have been 11 debris flows from 7 partial and 4 complete emptyings of moraine-dammed lakes. Most occurred between 1930 and 1950, with some as recent as the 1970's. Although deglaciation and resulting debris flows are not unique to the Oregon Cascades, they have been more severe in this region because these volcanoes are steep, extensively glacierized and composed of highly altered loose rock and fragmented material The Cascade Range extends from northern California to northern Washington and range in width from 50 to 120 km. It is composed primarily of upper Eocene to Quaternary volcanic, volcanoclastic, sedimentary and igneous intrusive rocks (O'Connor et al. 2001) The crest is at at elevation of 1500 to 2000 m, with several high volcanoes exceeding 3000 m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/60908c34-371c-4604-bb27-beb4bd96ca76.jpg" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
South Sister And Broken Top near Cascade Lakes Hwy, Oregon&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this earthcache I will be describing a debris flow that occurred in October 1966 in the Soda Creek drainage mainly upstream from Highway 49. It was triggered by the over-topping of a moraine-dammed lake at the East Bend Glacier located on Broken Top. During maximum neoglacial advances East Bend Glacier covered .24 square km and was attached to Bend Glacier before deglaciation separated them. At its largest size the lake created from the melting glacier contained 340,000 cubic meters of water and had a maximum depth of 18 m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 7,1966 140,000 cubic meters of water spilled over the outlet and partly breached the moraine dam. The resulting debris flow came down an unnamed tributary, then joined Crater Creek 6 km downstream from the breach. It then entered Soda Creek 1 km downstream. The debris flow followed Soda Creek another 3 km until it crossed Highway 49 (Cascade Lake Highway) and spread out over the large meadow near Sparks Lake. The meadow ended up being covered with approximately 250,000 square meters of sand and silt. The total distance the debris flow traveled between the breach and Sparks Lake was over 10 km.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within a week after the event reporters from the Bend bulletin made a trip to the site and reported that the dam breach was caused by the calving of a large block of ice into the lake. The debris flow began by eroding the moraine material that formed the dam, and then depending on slope, channel characteristics, and geologic properties of the bed material the flow began incorporating bedrock, trees, outwash and colluvium. Boulders as large as 2 m in diameter also moved with this mass of mud, rocks and vegetation. Estimates of discharge, based on channel dimensions and slope calculations, ranged from 380 cubic meters/sec to 20 cubic meters/sec along the 10 km flowpath. Some reaches were badly eroded where others acted as depositional zones, and by the time it reached Highway 49 and the meadow it ceased acting like a true debris flow, but rather a greatly enlarged Soda Creek heavily laden with a large sediment load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moraine Dams are especially susceptible to rapid failure that leads to debris flows for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep lakes that form behind moraine dams exert significant hydrostatic force.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Width to height ratios are generally small.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outlet slopes are generally very steep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The failure of these dams is usually caused by overtopping, piping or gravitational collapse. The most common type is the one I previously described; ice falls, rock falls, and avalanches into the lake causing large displacement waves that exit the outlet and collapse the dam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;To log this earthcache:&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Answer the following questions and email them to the developer of this earthcache:&lt;br /&gt;
There is a set of interpretive signs at the coordinates given for this earthcache. Use the information given on the signs to answer the following questions.
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first onto the scene following the debris flow ruled out what three environmental events/catastrophes that “did not” occur that could explain this mysterious flood?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30 years after the event a geological/hydrological study was conducted on Soda Creek to determine a restoration plan. Describe the different activities conducted on Soda Creek in the restoration process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This logging requirement is optional. Take a picture of yourself and the members in your group, and showing your GPS unit, with the mountains to the west in the background. This would assure me that you were at the site.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basic Visitor Use and Public Safety Information for Public Lands in Oregon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
All visitors need to plan ahead and prepare for outings in Oregon's public lands by:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowing the regulations and special concerns for the area you are planning to visit. Such as obeying the laws that prohibit the collection or destruction of artifacts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carrying a map and GPS unit and/or compass. Maps are available for purchase at all BLM and US Forest Service Offices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Staying on existing roads and trails.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planning for extreme weather, hazards, and emergencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carrying a full size spare tire, extra food and water, and warm clothes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being aware that cell phones DO NOT usually work in the rural areas away from major highways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leaving your travel plans with a responsible party, including the date and time of your return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linking to 'Tread Lightly and leave No Trace' websites &lt;a href="http://www.treadlightly.org/"&gt;(www.treadlightly.org&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.int.org/"&gt;www.int.org)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember the geocaching motto of 'Cache in Trash Out'.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Located above 6000' elevation at the site of the annual Mt Bachelor Star Party, this is the 2nd cache in my series of Stardust Memories caches.  These are the places I like to go to view the stars.

GPS readings are a bit difficult here due to terrain and mountains so I'm giving you some extra clues.

Latitude readings varied from 43* 59.549N to 43* 59.552N.
Longitude readigs varied from 121* 39.560W to 121*39.562W.
The readings for this cache seemed to be the most accurate but the highest accuracy I could obtain was 69'.

There is a dead snag just up the lava outcrop and a High Voltage sign (in poor shape) nearby.  The encoded clues will help you use these to find the cache.  Paces up here are not of uniform distance but tend to be determined by the terrain.

We astronomers prefer to use red lights at night to preserve our night vision so the original contents of the cache are several varieties of red flashlights.

Have fun, and stick around to see the stars some night!

UPDATE:  West Coast Weenies had better readings and left these coords - N 43° 59.543 W 121° 39.563
</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>From dead snag go thirteen paces west.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This cache can be found from the north side of Tumalo creek off road 4601. Finding this cache off Skylinner road could be difficult with no trail and some private property.

Once over the bridge to Tumalo Falls continue to the right to get on road 4601. Follow it for a mile and a half and take a right at N 44 02.515 - W 121 29.979 down a dirt road. Keep right at the fork and continue down to the cache. I drove it in a passenger car.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This area once was part of the failed Tumalo Reservoir system. About one hundred years ago a series of canals were built to bring the flow of the creek into the reservoir. The Reservoir failed to hold water and the whole project was eventually abandoned.
 
This is a small piece of what is left of the grand plan.

 We used it as a wading dock to cool off in the hot summer sun.

Enjoy modern acheology.

This cache is located on the high point of the ridge running between Tumalo Valley and and the Swede Ridge trail system. Follow rd 4615 from the Virginia Meissner snow park just off the Cascade Lakes Highway. It joins rd 300 after a few miles which ends at an old cinder pit. Follow the trail up from there for a great view. Walk around and you could make it into a 360 degree view.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">There is a nice trail up the backside of the hill. No need to scramble up the loose stuff.

As long as your out here why not try the bike trail, explore some of the shelters or continue on the walking trail from the top. Fun, fun, fun.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I wonderd why there was no cache up here yet. Low and behold I found one while placing my own. I started at the parking lot and hiked up the western edge of the crater. Got to a spot were I placed GC2ER6V. Looked across the rim and saw a hiker on the other side. By the time the dogs and I made over to this spot the man was gone. Looking for a nice place to hide my cache I tried different spots without success. I finally found a good spot for my ammo can. WHAT THE...??? There is already a can here. That dude must have left one on the same day I hiked up here to put one out. What a bummer,,,wait a second,,, this one looks old, with lots of crust on it. Took it out and found a gapertimmy cache from 2002 with no log entries in it and a undiscoverd TB. I took control of his old "FRESHIEZ" TB and put my own cache box were I found his. WHAT A WEIRD COINCIDENCE!!! The exact spot I wanted to hide my cache I found an old virgin cache in the  same spot. Got the can sitting in front of me as I log this new cache in, and it stinks of old and musk. mmmmm...goodness. E-mailed him to see if he wants his ammo box back.?

Met the dude I saw on top going down. He just didn't have it in him to make it to the summit.

I began the original multi-cache, "darkside of the cone," in 2002 but a bad stage prevented me from continuing and then it was archived soon after. Eleven years later I found the final in the form of this cache. At least I can still make it up here! 

The mountain was abuzz with tourists, disc golf players, dog sled teams and chainsaws. We even heard a tree being felled. Mild temperatures and partly cloudy skies made for a pleasant hike up. Great views. Thanks for a reason to complete what I started over a decade ago!</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Fingers crossed the rain would hold out, we set out to climb the cinder cone with Bend Cache Collectors. The climb up was a bit of a challenge, especially with the brisk wind, but successful! Beautiful view of Sparks Lake with patches of blue sky overhead! Hiked the ridge over to the other cone to retrieve that cache too. Climb down was much easier than the trip up and the rain did hold off.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Fun afternoon caching with djkfisher!  We decided on trying something a bit more challenging today, so we climbed up the cinder cone to grab these two lonely caches.  We came up a harder way, but then found the easier way down after finding both caches.  There was also a nice stiff breeze so it was a bit chilly.  We dumped the water out of the container, but the log sheet was still dry.  The views alone make this deserving of a fav point!  Also, this was cache #3500 for us.  TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Headed over here after Darkside. From the parking lot this second summit is hiding--the cone is actually more of a crescent. Buzzed by a falcon while we were at the cache. The waterproof container had a half-inch of water in it because the seal was dirty and not closed properly. Dried it out as best we could, replaced the damp log in a new baggie, and added a desiccant in hopes that would help dry the waterlogged pencil. Thanks for the second find in a scenic location!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This is the first in a series of Mt. Bachelor cache's to highlight some of the unkown spots on our fav ski hill.  The hike is off trail, about 100' elevation gain from the Sunrise Lodge.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">~The Legendary Snafflehound Cavern~
This hunt will take you to a secret spot on the east side of Mt. Bachelor.  You can reach the said coordinates by driving to the Sunrise Lodge parking lot, and hiking up towards the top of the Carosuel chair.  If the gates are closed, your walk will be a bit longer, but still pretty darn easy.

The cache can be reached via hiking in the woods, or you can walk up the service road, and the cache is only about 150 yards from this road, its up to you!

The snafflehound is a crazy little creature that is seen througout the wilderness.  The contents of the cache will help you out with your own hunt for a wild snafflehound!

The cache is a clear tupperware container with the following inside.
- 2 squirt guns (you provide the ammo)
- Glo Sticks (when activated this will daze the snaffle)
- Lone Ranger mask (duh!)
- Ice Pack (to apply to any snaffle bites)
- Glow in the dark silly putty
- A shark to scare snaffles from hiding
- Some mints to give your new pet some fresh breath
- And the Dumbo travel bug is now holed up in the snafflehound cavern.  I guess we'll find out if elephants like to ski or ride!

*other notes*
This interesting lava tube is used by snow riders in the winter as an aparent party area, and it would be great if all the visit could pick up some trash.  I'm guessing you could make about $5 from can returns from this cache alone.

Also, there is snow inside the cavern/tube right now which makes it nice and cool, unfortunately, the skeeters have realized this as well!

Do not attempt to drive up the Mt. Bachelor service road, you will get in trouble!

Have fun!

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I parked along the highway about 150 yards below the gate since there were so many vehicles parked near the gate. The temp was in the low 80's. There was snow that was nearly a foot deep inside the cavern. The cache was dry and in good shape. Mine was the first log for 2013 TNLNSL.

Pretty quick find using the hint. Very interesting spot - we wondered what this is like in the winter, completely covered with snow, or a known location/hazard? This is currently our highest elevation cache. TFTH.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Nice.  a second FTF for the day.  When we saw that the next cache in the series was fairly close, we decided to continue on the path.  I mean, really, how far could it be [:D].  Probably at least twice the distance that the bird would fly to grab it.  The trail reminded me of the Wildwood Trail in Forest Park where at one point, you will walk almost a mile to go .1  The coor. were very good for us.  Our GPS said 17 when I got to GZ and 8 when I left.  

We were in a bit of a time crunch for this hike so when the next one said .57 miles away.  I calculated the minimum walking distance to be a mile or more and we just didn't have time.  By the time we got back to the car, I think we had about 4 miles on our GPS.  Thanks for the caches and for the August FTF's.</groundspeak:text>

Look for GC2BA25 near the lodge. I did not have time to find.

Parked by the road where there was evidence of some sort of road that used to lead into the lake but we walked down that until we got to the lake area and there were a lovely bunch of geese that we would end up disturbing on our journey to the cache. The water was nice to walk in at this point even though it was getting late.

No trees were killed to send this message, but a large number of electrons were terribly inconvenienced

Bachelor for $15 per adult, unless you are a season pass holder. Or for  free, you can hike up the access road starting at Sunrise Lodge. The terrain near the cache is very steep. The cache is located on the north side of Pine Martin Lodge. The beautiful view is worth the trip up the mountain.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Another hard one to get without a boat but totally worth it because we saw a grey heron alight in a tree on our way over. Nearly dropped my backpack in the water while signing the log for this cache and it was becoming obvious that we were tired from our many hours of geocaching… very happy to head home after this one and just easily walk back to the road instead of trying to walk through the forested area around the lake which is very very dense. Was always disappointed to see the ratings were so easy cause you were supposed to be boating to them [:P] 

No trees were killed to send this message, but a large number of electrons were terribly inconvenienced

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;center&gt;This is a short hike on National Forest land along an established trail past several ancient rock paintings.  The actual cache is further down the trail away from the paintings.  Some of these paintings are even visible from the road if one knows to look for them.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to the Central Oregon Art Gallery.  Feel free to look around and explore, but PLEASE don't touch!  The museum curator will be watching you, but may be a tad bored at times, so he might be willing to trade places with another travel bug.  Be sure to leave at least one TB to watch over the Art Gallery at all times.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

As you walk the trail to the cache, stop and look at the sights.  If you have any insights into what you see, feel free to express your opinions here.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

Stop 1: N 44 01.981, W 121 45.366&lt;BR&gt;
Stop 2: N 44 01.980, W 121 45.362&lt;BR&gt;
Stop 3: N 44 01.968, W 121 45.318&lt;BR&gt;
Stop 4: N 44 01.964, W 121 45.314&lt;BR&gt;
Stop 5: N 44 01.965, W 121 45.280 (Note: this one is way up and requires climbing to see clearly)&lt;BR&gt;
Stop 6: Use the given coordinates for the cache.  The final stop is the cache itself, but of course, what would be the fun of just going directly to it?!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

The cache is a large ammo box filled with many goodies and and even a First Finder's prize!  Since we recently found our 100th cache, we figured it was time to give back.  Feel free to trade what you wish, but Artistic items would be greatly appreciated!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

Note: The terrain/difficulty will be much harder in the winter, since the main road is closed due to snow at Mt. Bachelor.  Snowmobilers, horse riders, snowshoers, or skiers are welcome to search too!

6/19/04 The cache is in good shape after the winter.  We are finding that the GPS signals get blocked when you get close to the cache, so the results are pretty mixed (today we got 44 0.956, 121 45.170, while the posted coordinates were averaged for over 15 minutes when we placed the cache!)  We recommend using the hints when you get close.  A little scrambling is required.&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;01GVKY - Stop 1&lt;br /&gt;N 44° 01.981 W 121° 45.366&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;02GVKY - Stop 2&lt;br /&gt;N 44° 01.980 W 121° 45.362&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;03GVKY - Stop 3&lt;br /&gt;N 44° 01.968 W 121° 45.318&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;04GVKY - Stop 4&lt;br /&gt;N 44° 01.964 W 121° 45.314&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;05GVKY - Stop 5&lt;br /&gt;N 44° 01.965 W 121° 45.280&lt;br /&gt;Note: this one is way up and requires climbing to see clearly&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">In the mid 1970s portions of the movie “Rooster Cogburn” were filmed in the Cascades west of Bend. A friend of mine, Ted, was employed by the Forest Service at the time and was assigned to work with the cast as a guide, wrangler etc. Sometimes he was tasked to drive Katherine Hepburn around once she arrived at the staging area. Ted told me the following story:</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Apparently Kate had an early morning ritual on the way to the staging area. She would have her chauffer drive down an obscure little dirt road off of the Cascade Lakes Highway to Sparks Lake. While the chauffer made sure no one else came down the road, Kate would go for a quick skinny dip in the lake. Then she’d have him drive her to where Ted and the rest of the crew were waiting.

The little road is still there, although it is now blocked off with big boulders at the highway. 

The most interesting way to get this cache is via kayak from the boat ramp on the east shore of Sparks Lake (N44°00.842’ W121°44.283). If you choose the water route you’ll want to paddle directly across to the west shore of the lake to the beginning of a channel at N44°01.101’ W121°44.867’ and then follow the channel north to the next expanse of open water. Continue to hug the west bank all the way to the cache. The distance is around 1.3 miles from the ramp, across the lake and then northerly to the cache. I’m not sure if a canoe can make this trip. Some portions are very shallow and I had to hunt and peck for deep water in many places. 

If you try to navigate from the boat ramp in a straight line to the cache you’ll end up walking most of the way as the lake along this path isn’t much deeper than a cereal bowl. 

The cache is about 30 feet into the woods on the west side of  a small channel. It is a small plastic container in a nook at the base of a standing tree. 

If you opt to approach from the dirt road off the highway you will need to cross the channel. Although the water is only ankle deep you are likely to sink knee deep into the silt...trust me on this. Distance from the highway to the cache is 0.2 miles +/-.

Either the water level was deeper in 1974 or the lake has silted in considerably in the ensuing 33 years, because you’d be hard pressed to find water deep enough to swim in now. Although I don’t doubt Ted’s story. He’s a straight shooter.

Whether you choose by land or by sea, be sure to bring mosquito repellent. They’ll be waiting for you.

Please carefully re-hide the cache as you found it to keep it dry during the 9 months it will be under snow.</groundspeak:long_description>

There is a standing dead six inch dia. buckskin (no bark on it) tree about two feet south of the cache tree.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This EarthCache is located at a viewpoint near the boat ramp at Sparks Lake, a high mountain lake along the Cascade Lakes Scenic Byway. The given coordinates will take you to two interpretive signs. To log this cache, you will need to travel to the coordinates, read the interpretive signs, read this page, and look at the surrounding lava formations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking at the boat ramp requires a $5 day use fee or Northwest Forest Pass.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;h2&gt;Geologic History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sparks Lake was formed approximately 10,000 years ago when lava flowed into this area and, upon cooling, formed a natural rock dam that began capturing snowmelt and rainwater. Some of these lava flows also formed what is known as inflated lava.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/f0666ec9-827c-402b-89d7-ec06f0a64eeb.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inflated Lava&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steep-walled lava rock outcrops are created when lava goes through a process called inflation. As lava flows over a relatively flat area and spreads like an expanding puddle, its rate of advance begins to slow down. Eventually, the lava cools, the crust thickens, and the flow’s edges solidify and come to a halt. As new, fluid lava enters the flow, it becomes easier to lift the cooled crust than to push the flow horizontally through the solidified edges. So the flow surface actually rises vertically, lifting the entire flow sheet. Such flows are capable of inflating and thickening by many meters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Variations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tumuli.&lt;/strong&gt; Places where inflation is overly concentrated are called &lt;em&gt;tumuli&lt;/em&gt; (singular: tumulus). Tumuli are oval, dome-shaped structures ranging in size from 2 to 10 meters high. They typically have a central crack along the spine of the tumulus where lava pushed up and buckled the surface layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deflated lava.&lt;/strong&gt; Most inflated flows solidify in place; however, some will &lt;em&gt;deflate&lt;/em&gt; if the fluid core drains away from beneath the solid crust. Deflation is more likely to occur in the center of the flow since this is where lava is least solidified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pits.&lt;/strong&gt; Another less-common feature of inflated lava flows are &lt;em&gt;lava-rise pits&lt;/em&gt;. Lava-rise pits form when areas within the flow do not inflate. The flow inflates to a thickness equivalent to the depth of the pit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Logging this EarthCache&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please send an email with answers to the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. What was the source of the lava flow?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. How high (in feet) did the lava inflate in some places?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Walk out to the end of the boat ramp, look out over the lake (west/southwest) and view the inflated lava. Do you see indications of tumuli, deflation, or lava-rise pits? (this is subjective, but let me know what you think you see out there)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Do you think the inflated lava formed before or after Sparks Lake was formed? Why or why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photos are welcome, but not required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have emailed your answers, feel free to log your find immediately - you do not need to wait for a response. Please do not post the answers to the questions within your log. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

The lake is losing water fast. Good thing we did this today.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This Earthcache is located at a viewpoint along the Cascade Lakes Highway. The given coordinates will take you to two interpretive signs. To answer the questions and log this cache, you will need to read one of the signs, read this page, and study your surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;h2&gt;What is a Tuya?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subglacial volcanoes are called &lt;strong&gt;tuyas&lt;/strong&gt;, a distinctive type of flat-topped, steep-sided volcano formed when lava erupts through a thick glacier or ice sheet. Tuya volcanoes are &lt;strong&gt;relatively rare phenomena&lt;/strong&gt;, mostly found in regions which were covered by glaciers and had active volcanism during the same period, such as British Columbia, Iceland, &lt;strong&gt;Oregon&lt;/strong&gt; and under the Antarctic ice sheets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just 26 miles north of where you are standing, also in the Cascade Range, is a classic tuya volcano named Hayrick Butte. This textbook example of a tuya was formed when its eruptions could not penetrate the overlying ice sheet, thus creating a flat-topped butte. The steep sides formed because the molten lava was trapped by the surrounding ice, which also cooled the lava quickly, thus solidifying the steep sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other characteristics of a tuya volcano:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Columnar joints&lt;/strong&gt; – formed by rapid cooling of the lava at the ice (water) interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hyaloclastite&lt;/strong&gt; – black, glassy material resulting from rapid quenching of liquid lava by melted ice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pillow lava&lt;/strong&gt; – formed when water (melted glacial ice) quickly cools the lava; similar to shapes found on underwater volcanoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the photo below, compare flat-topped Hayrick Butte (classic tuya) on the right with Hoodoo Butte on the left, a typical rounded (scoria or strombolian) cinder cone which erupted perhaps thousands of years after Hayrick and definitely after the ice sheet had completely melted away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/5f4a3cd4-ecf2-438a-9f02-2bfbf8ca377f.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo by Lee Siebert, 1995 (Smithsonian Institution)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Back to our current location . . .&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years ago, this entire area also was iced over by glaciers. Then Talapus and Katsuk Buttes began to erupt beneath the ice sheet. Although this sounds like the beginning of two tuya volcanoes, Talapus and Katsuk Buttes both formed into everyday, typical cinder cones that sit atop a peculiarly steep-sided plateau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This underlying steep-sided plateau DOES display many characteristics of having erupted against glacier ice. But, for whatever reason, perhaps the ice sheet was thin and the lava boiled away the ice, the buttes on top of the plateau do not display the same tuya-like characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we appear to have a tuya plateau topped by two non-tuya cinder cones. The interpretive sign will further explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Logging this Earthcache&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please send an email with answers to the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. How many years ago was this area covered by a glacier?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. What is the name of the yellowish-brown rock and soil deposits across the highway from where you are standing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Why are tuyas more rare than typical, rounded-shape cinder cones?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photos are welcome, but not required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have emailed your answers, feel free to log your find immediately - you do not need to wait for a response. Please do not post the answers to the questions within your log. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

Sure enough! Nice place for a cache.  Found the first pretty easy, though there were muggles sunbathing nearby, and found the correct second.  Nice big cache with lots of swag.  All photos have been taken with the camera in the cache. Drew a palm tree with the art supplies in the log.  Thanks.</groundspeak:text>

We were successful in saving some baby frogs and we were also successful in finding the cache!  Thank you for the fun multi, it was fun to pick up a few caches while in the area.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">The upper cache in this series (#2 and #4 have been archived) is an ammo box located on the Mrazek Trail, a popular mountain bike route connecting Shevlin Park to Tumalo Falls and beyond.
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;img src="http://idisk.mac.com/main_street/Public/mtn-bike-friendly-art.jpg" align="right" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trail options:&lt;/b&gt; The cache can be reached by either the Mrazek Trail or by the hikers-only Tumalo Creek Trail. If walking, you can make this into an 8- to 11-mile round trip that combines both trails. It's possible to drive to near the cache but why would you want to do that and miss the best scenery?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Getting there:&lt;/b&gt; The trails can be reached from either Shevlin Park or from the old Brooks haul road (Forest Service Road 4612).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Shevlin Park, start at Fremont Meadow (N 44° 03.731' W 121° 23.763') and head upstream. You can stop by Cruise by the Creek 1 and several other caches on the way. Continue on the trail upstream along Tumalo Creek. The trail then switchbacks 200 feet up and out of the park. Near the top of the switchbacks at a signed trail junction, the Mrazek Trail goes right and the Tumalo Creek Trail takes off to the left; the trails meet again in several miles. Go right if on bicycle, or take either trail if on foot. This approach is longer than the option below but takes you through an especially nice area of Shevlin Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also intersect both trails on unpaved Forest Service Road 4612 above Shevlin Park. Drive out Skyliner Road a few miles past Mt. Washington Drive and take a right onto a gravel road at about MP 3.7. Take a left onto 4612 at the stop sign and go a couple miles to Tumalo Creek. A pullout and trailhead to the Tumalo Creek Trail (hikers only) is just across the bridge at N 44° 03.107' W 121° 24.721'. A little farther down the road you'll come cross the Tumalo Creek Trail again, then a side road, and finally the Mrazek Trail (N 44°03.568' W 121°24.613'). Park here and start pedaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache originally stocked with bicycling items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Further adventures:&lt;/b&gt; After the cache, you can return the way you came or, if hiking, take the other trail to make a loop out of it. If biking, you may want to continue up the Mrazek Trail father into the forest.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;This cache could also be called "What were we thinking?"&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">On August 7th, 2001, the two senior members of TZI tied the knot at
the summit of the third highest peak in the state. That's right, on
top of South Sister, also known as Charity, or as we sometimes call
it, South Sinister. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
What were we thinking? Well, we figured the area was remote enough
and the trek difficult enough that we would have a very small
wedding party. We figured correctly. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This cache was placed to commemorate five years of blissful peace
and harmony in the TZI household. The cache also celebrates our
sixth year in a row of hiking the mountain on this date. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
To find this cache, you are gonna have to hike this sucker, just
like we do every year. The pursuit of this cache is not for those
with weak tickers or bum knees. You will be hiking about 12 miles,
with a vertical gain of almost one mile. The summit sits at 10,358
feet. The round-trip hike takes us about 8 hours, with a one hour
lunch break at the summit (depending on the weather at the top),
and shorter rest stops along the way. We seem to hike at an average
pace, so adjust your hiking itinerary accordingly.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 We rated this cache for summer hiking only. For winter hiking,
well, we don't recommend it really. For one thing, at least one
waypoint would be buried in snow, as well as the final cache site.
Late July through early October may be decent months to seek the
treasure. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Here's our advice:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Start early.&lt;br&gt;
 Take water.&lt;br&gt;
 Lots of water.&lt;br&gt;
 Wear sunblock.&lt;br&gt;
 Take a hat.&lt;br&gt;
 Take an extra layer of clothing.&lt;br&gt;
 Maybe even a rainjacket.&lt;br&gt;
 Wear sturdy shoes.&lt;br&gt;
 Bring ibuprofen.&lt;br&gt;
 And blister pads or moleskin.&lt;br&gt;
 Take a camera.&lt;br&gt;
 And more water.&lt;br&gt;
 And food.&lt;br&gt;
 And hiking poles if you've got 'em. You'll wish you did if you
don't.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Begin your adventure by parking near the posted coordinates, at
Devil's Lake Trailhead parking lot. If you park at the coords
listed above, you'll need a NW Forest Pass. If you don't believe in
supporting such things, you can live life on the edge and park at
the pullout along the highway. You will still need to go to the
posted coords to begin your journey though. There, you can use the
restroom and throw away your coffee cup. And don't forget to
stretch! Are you ready to start your adventure? &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;You are trying to solve:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 N 44 AB.CDE, W 121 FG.HIJ.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt; There are four waypoints, all of which are along the
established trail to the summit. Collect information as follows:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Waypoint #1: At N 44 02.126, W 121 45.940&lt;/b&gt;, there is a large
wooden sign. What's the Trail No.? This number = KL.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Now, follow the trail, and head up the mountain! &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Waypoint #2: At N 44 03.315, W 121 46.267&lt;/b&gt;, stop for a
breather, and maybe shed a layer of clothing. You should be
standing in an area with three signposts. You need to look at the
middle signpost, and find the small sign that says something about
our canine companions. How many letters in the third word of the
dog sign? This number = M. How many bolts attach the dog sign to
the post? This number = N. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Enjoy the flattish terrain while you can. Onward and upward! And
don't forget to hydrate! &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Waypoint #3: At N 44 04.741, W 121 46.128&lt;/b&gt;, there is a sign
with seven words. How many letters in the first word? This number =
O.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 Now the fun really begins! Don't worry, we won't interrupt your
hiking pleasure again until you reach the top. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Waypoint #4: At N 44 06.209, W 121 46.160&lt;/b&gt;, there is a
reference mark in a rock. What year is on the marker? This number =
PQRS.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 If you're not too oxygen starved from the high altitude, we have
some math for you. Don't worry, it's pretty basic stuff. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Solve N 44 AB.CDE:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt; A=M+P-K&lt;br&gt;
 B=N-M&lt;br&gt;
 C=P+R-L&lt;br&gt;
 D=O+P&lt;br&gt;
 E=N+K+P&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;Solve W 121 FG.HIJ:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt; F=R-P&lt;br&gt;
 G=K+M&lt;br&gt;
 H=S+P&lt;br&gt;
 I=M+N+M&lt;br&gt;
 J=Q-P&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Now, go find that cache! And enjoy your very long hike back to the
car! &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We can’t write a DNF, but we did want to make note of our attempt. After meeting up with MADRAMS (from WI) and BrewerMD (from Bellingham,) we made the beautiful drive down from Western Washington.  We spent the night in the nearby horse camp. 

At 5:00 am we got up and prepared to hike.  The clouds had rolled in overnight.  We are used to waking up to clouds and having them burn off as the day progressed.  No problem.  We were on the trail and ready to go by 6:00 am.  WOW, we have never seen such a full parking lot so early in the morning. 

As we went up the mountain the clouds appeared to thicken and it spit rain down on us several times.  By the time we reached the ridge at 8,900ish feet, it was 35*, the wind was really blowing with cold ice embedded, and you could not see more than 20 feet in front of you.  We decided that we would rather attempt the summit on a nicer day and turned around.

THANK YOU for placing, and maintaining, a cache is such a beautiful location.  We will be back to finish this!  ☺  Definitely not a DNF, but a NT (next time!)</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This has been on the to-do list for years, and we finally had a day to make the hike. Lucky for us it was slightly colder than normal for August, making this a great weather day for a strenuous climb. Epic cache, one of our favorites. TZI hid some of the most memorable caches back when we started geocaching, and this is no exception.</groundspeak:text>

On this hazy summer morning, there was not much difference between the two. [V] But we got to see thousands of stars as we hiked up in darkness, and neither of us will ever forget that. I guess we will have to return for the REAL views. Thank you for the memorable geocache!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">November 7, 2014 We snuck up to Western Exposure one last time before the snows came to tuck her away for winter. The coordinate I have posted in my log entry are the most accurate I have, but let me know if you have any trouble...Next year a Brand New Ammo Box for sure, so find her while she is orange and easy.
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located on one of the prettiest, most diverse hiking trails in the Cascades. Awesome views of all our favorite mountains along with a great place to dunk your footsies when the hike is over. The cache is located about 300 feet off of a loop trail. You do not need to cross actual lava if you scout out the area. (Trust the trail to guide you past the rocks) duck under a little wooden rainbow on your left, hop over some small logs and stay alongside the lave flow on the easy ground. You will avoid any skinned knees and hurt feelings if you follow this path. If however, you get to the SHORTCUT sign on the main path you have gone too far. You do not need to move any kind of rock to get at or see this cache, but you do have to explore a bit. Make sure to finish the whole loop to enjoy every bit. I didn't see a Geocoin in here today. The cache is in a medium size ammo box in the very latest "Orange!" style. Well, it was the latest style 12 years ago! We hope you love it as much as we do!

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Most likely only available only in the summer and fall, this is a single point cache that takes geocacher through a scenic lava flow. Total round trip distance is approximately 1 mile. The cache is located just off the main trail.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">By land or by sea? That's your choice! With the great views to the high cascades, either choice is spectacular! The "land" route will take you on a beautiful short loop hike along the shores of Sparks Lake and through lava flows forested with lodgepole pines. This trail is named for Oregon’s long-time photographer laureate, Ray Atkeson, and is located in one of his favorite places. The "sea" route will take into unknown coves and challenge your ability to find a suitable landing spot amongst the lava strewn shoreline. A Northwest Forest Pass is required for parking. </groundspeak:long_description>

The new Cache box is there in the shell.

This cache appears to be missing. I'm temporarily disabling it to give the owner the opportunity to check on the cache and repair it if necessary. If the owner feels they will not be able to repair this in a timely manner (i.e., within two weeks), let me know, and I'll archive it. This will keep the cache from continually showing up in search lists.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Area is being salvaged logged at this time.</groundspeak:text>

Didn't want to sit around inside and waste a beautiful afternoon. I (Mrs. dasein) wanted to be at the top of Mt. Bachelor, so took a rather spur-of-the-moment hike. Hadn't thought to check if there was a geocache up here beforehand; I just happened to run across it while I was exploring the summit. It wasn't hidden well at all. I signed the log, TNLN, and hid it much better. A nice surprise on a lovely afternoon.</groundspeak:text>

The trail is, um, interesting but way better than trying to climb over boulders. Had no idea it was so rough and rocky under the snow. After we found the cache and trudged back down we headed to Cultus Lake Lodge for all-you-can-eat ribs. Exhausted but happy. Thanks for the epic cache!</groundspeak:text>

That would not have been so bad in August, but there was a skin of ice on parts of the lake this morning. The good part was my feet were numb so I didn't feel it when I stubbed my toe on a sharp rock. Once I got down here I savored the sunshine and the solitude. No one else was out on the water. Found the cache in good shape. Thanks.</groundspeak:text>

After the uphill trudge to get it (all our other finds for the day were pretty close to the road so this was the most substantial walk to a cache today) we looked but quickly found it. Only other thing on the hill was horse poo and that wasn't much for company. Cache was healthy and dry which is always a nice to find. Ended up being our last find for the day because the last cache we went looking for is most likely missing [:(]</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Camp Sparks is located at Sparks Lake in the Wilderness west of Bend, Oregon.  This cache is part of a recent cluster that could make a fine weekend if worked together.  Use of a human powered watercraft is required for three of the seven.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Camp Sparks will open your eyes to alternative backcountry camping in the Three Sisters Wilderness.  Use of a human powered watercraft is recommended but not required if your tolerance for bush-whacking is high.  Canoe/kayak camping is possible as a base for the cluster.  Watch out for the very sharp reefs!

The original cache contains the log, Geo-advisory notice, an EB Airlines Jumbo Jet (scored from Marooned), dice erasers (8), a yellow clip, a new wrist watch, one jar opener (white), one sealed Cliff Bar (cranberry apple cherry), yellow golf balls (2), pet rocks (blond and brunette, please keep them together), a red clip, a brass military uniform button, one doll button, one red monkey, one butterfly adhesive pack and a catalog of all the USGS quad maps in Oregon.

If you come by water, look for the small south side sandy beach.  Bring the clue as your GPS may not see well although the coordinates given are based on eight MOB marks over fifteen minutes by two GPS units (an Etrex and a very costly Garman) seeing eight to nine satellites!

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">This cache will take you on a trip from the Sparks Lake boat ramp
and back again. It is advisable to do this by boat as you have to
cross the lake a couple times. This would NOT be a fun hike around
the lake and back.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I don’t know who Rick was, but his friends and family must have
loved him dearly and he liked the same places we do. If you know
anything about Rick, please feel free to share it in your cache
log. 
&lt;p&gt;Park at the Sparks Lake boat ramp (You will need to buy a Forest
Service parking permit)and launch your boat (or start a big ugly
hike). The starting coordinates will take you to a beach where you
will find some information about Rick. The info is at the tree line
by the beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will find two dates (8 numerals per date), separated by a
slash. Assign the numbers of the dates, from left to right, the
letters A through P:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
AB-CD-EFGH / IJ – KL - MNOP&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Do the following math to come up with the coordinates for the
cache:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the starting latitude, add .GHD and to the starting longitude
add .INO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 N 44°00.184”
      + .GHD
 -----------
 N 44°00.???”
 
W121°44.724”
     + .INO
-----------
W121°44.???
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache can be grabbed on the way back to the boat ramp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can literally grab it from your boat if the water's not too
low&lt;/p&gt;
This cache was improvised on the spot, so the container, original
contents (pocket change and some sea shells) and log book were
cobbled together with whatever I had on hand, including my trusty
survival duct-tape pencil. Please don’t take the pencil as I’ll try
to swap it out later this year. 
&lt;p&gt;Terrain Rating = 5 because Geocaching.com recommends that caches
which require special equipment (boats) be rated as such. If you do
this one on foot, it'd probably be around a 3. All in all it's an
easy paddle and fun for the whole family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Cache is on the water side of big rock out-crop. About a foot up from the high water mark in a rock cleft right below a low lying bush. Cache has a small rock on it so it won't float away in high water.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Indian Paintbrush, aka Prairie-Fire: a large group of
parasitic plants found throughout the Americas from sea level to
alpine regions. Often bright red but can vary from orange to
scarlet to purple to even white or yellow. Their color comes from
dense, bright bracts that surround the actual flower. The flowers
can be used as a condiment and have health benefit similar to
garlic.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is at an interesting trail feature and is close to the
only side road (4WD) that crosses the 4-mile trail. This section of
the trail is relatively flat and close to the creek for roughly a
half-mile in either direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you choose to drive to the cache, do yourself a favor and
walk part of the trail to get a feel for this tumultuous section of
the creek lined by lilies and other wildflowers. Better yet, hike
down from the upper (western) trailhead near the old Columbia Canal
(now dry). If you have two vehicles it would be possible to leave
one at the lower trailhead for Penstemon and hike the entire 4
miles--which feels more like 7 miles. Some parts of the trail are
unsuitable for kids and dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a decon container about 20 feet east of the
trail feature. You will have to move a small, flat rock to see
it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;TH1VJKM - Upper trailhead&lt;br /&gt;N 44° 02.633 W 121° 28.051&lt;br /&gt;Trailhead near western end of Tumalo Creek Trail with room for a couple of cars. Reached from Jack Pine Spring Road.&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

We came in from the east today and stopped by a 2 other caches in this series.  Its a great hike and a great set of caches.  The lucky trackable "30 Years of Conservation" helped us.  Took Pet Parade button, left Timbers button.  Thanks.</groundspeak:text>

Really wanted to find this one today and be the first to find in five years (FTFIFY). We looked for about an hour and couldn't come up with it.  Thought for sure since owner logged that it was still in place that we would find.  GPS bounced a lot which didn't help and not sure if we fully understood the hint and the last line in the description. After a lot of looking and rock turning, had to give up. Cool spot for a cache.

Note that the 4WD road down to the creek has been closed but can be hiked or peddled. Or use the hiking trailhead at the given waypoint. Also, the entire area including forest roads is off limits to motor vehicles December 1 through March 31 for wildlife.</groundspeak:text>

When you’re closing in on the coordinates keep a look out for a vehicle turnout, you'll need it.  The cache is not far from this parking location but there may be some rather moderate "scrambling" over rocks to do depending on the route you choose.  When you arrive at the location you'll have to look carefully because there are rocks EVERYWHERE!  Could it be hidden under some rocks?  Let us know what you think!


ADDITIONAL NEW NOTES!!!
After some very helpful feedback we saw the need for a little more information.  

We've adjusted the coordinates a bit after double checking our original numbers.  If you need/want, we offer some compass bearings in the encrypted hints below that you may use to cross reference the cache location.  All compass bearings are true not magnetic.
</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>1) Approximately 28' from tree with short horizontal bend at bearing of 040 deg true.

2) Approximately 80' at 160 deg true from base of fallen twin tree with no bark.  Twin tree is approximately 100' at 005 deg from tree in hint #1.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This well hidden no real name lake is .58 mile from the Sisters Mirror Lake trail head.  Bushwhacking is required unless you take one of the horse trails in the area. The hike while relatively short is over moderately rough terrain so be prepared to crawl over some blowdown and work around a few lava ridges. The cache is hidden in a fairly obvious location...once you get there. Take time for a dip. The water is great! Swim suits optional!(*_*) </groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The Sisters Mirror Lake trail head is a NW Forest Pass pay to park site. 
If you do not have a Forest pass and don't want to "pay to park" there are a couple of places to pull off beyond the 1/4 mile parking restriction area along the Cascade Lakes Highway. They will ticket you if you park at the trail head without a pass (if they catch you).

*NOTE SUMMER OF 2005 THE "LAKE" IS DRY!* READ THE LOGS*!)

Early this morn we saddled up and headed out to get this one and get in one final ride before heading home.  There was a little too much blow down off the trail to get the horses there so we tied up and hiked in the final 100 yards off the trail.

We attempted this one last fall from the Sister's Mirror Lake parking lot, but alas it was late in the day, snow on the ground and starting to get dark and snow again…so we decided to wait until summer.  The North South trail comes within .10 of the Cache.  It is equal distance from Quinn Meadow trailhead and Devil's Lake Trail head - about 1.45.  It is only .47 from the Mirror lake parking area, but it will be all cross county.

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The first irrigation canals were originally built by the Three Sisters Irrigation Company. 40 miles of canals were constructed with a crew of 12-15 men with mule and horse driven scapers and shovels. The Columbia Southern Canal (named for the Columbia Southern Irrigation Company) was re-build in 1913-1915 along with new construction of the Tumalo Canal and Tumalo Reservoir as part of the Tumalo Irrigation Project. In 1915 The Tumalo reservoir failed to hold water from sinkholes. Due to the high cost of repairs the project was abandoned and the Columbia Southern Canal was never used again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section of the canal the engineers took advantage of the existing canyon for a 1/2 mile stretch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6;"&gt;Just downstream from the canyon is the remnants of the construction camp and #1106 Columbia Stone Quarry site. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section of the Columbia Southern Canal is documented in the Library of Congress as "Big Cut” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(see photo gallery).&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I figured Big Eddy should do Big Cut on this cloudy afternoon. I staggered up the bottom of the canyon, stopping often for photos, to the easy find. I then backtracked to the upper trail to check out the drop-off farther up. Strange scenery with the burn and the eroding canyon walls, so eroded that I found myself posed to duck for cover if I heard anything falling--definitely deserves a cliff attribute. 

I'm familiar with the canal and have a cache along it 4 miles up, but I had not seen this dramatic section before. It struck me how today we can't even get Mirror Pond dredged but a century ago they did crazy things like this with nary a thought. I imagine few geocachers will venture here but if you do bring your camera, wear your dirt clothes and enjoy another of man's water folly projects. Note that Road 4606 is gated during the winter (Dec. 1 to March 31) for wildlife.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">It was AWSOME. Parked at the old camp area. It looked like a party spot down below in the mini meadow. We stayed on the upper trail passing lots of old rust and a cool looking old purple bottle on the way. It was dry on both sides of the trail with the 2 bulls fire on the right and the thousands of years of pumice layers to the left. That was a hot, hot fire. Got next to the cache site but decided to walk up the little hill about another 400 feet up the trail. Way Cool. The deep canyon ended in a big bowl at what appears to be an old dry waterfall with a 30 foot drop. Wish there was a picture of that with water flowing over it. I wonder if there used to be a name for it? Backtracked a bit and found a way down to the cache and the unique marker. Weird. That was a nicely done container skanderson. Followed the canal back to the truck checking out the huge slabs of rock that have sheared off the sides. The dogs had fun exploring the cracks and crevices. Perfect cache for us. Off leash, no people, history and a hike. Thanks for a fun afternoon.

Let the dogs cool down at Shevlin Park on the way home.

The cache location was near a favorite of his for taking pictures of the Three Sisters. Jermo introduced me to geocaching in 2003 and I've been hooked ever since. Jermo had many fun caching experiences with one of his favorite friends, Charm. I hope you enjoy this cache and the views of the Three Sisters!

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This cache is located near Big Spring. There is an interesting place where someone has put a cement waterbox with a pipe leading out of it. Possibly there was a cabin here at one time? We aren't sure of the history so if someone knows put it in your log. We also found another interesting relic that made us wonder how it got here.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Suggested parking coordinates are N 43 58.752 W 121 30.907. There is a narrow forest road that dead ends at a good parking place but I would not drive that road any more since I could not find it on the new forest management road. I don't want anyone getting a ticket for driving that road. The cache is just a nice walk from the listed parking coordinates. 

The cement waterbox is located at N 43 58.841 W 121 30.228. I'm including a picture but it doesn't show the detail very well.

We won the cache container at Bubblegummer's 66 Bash. 

We took several readings of the cache coordinates with 2 GPS units. The readings were consistently the same, yet when we tried to follow the coords back to the cache it was 20' off.

challenging 5.5-mile round-trip ski or snowshoe? Marked trails in
beautiful area. No digging required.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Start at Edison Sno-Park off Forest Road 45. Park at south end of
lot which is shared with snowmobilers (they have their own trails).
Sno-Park Permit required in season. Dogs welcome. 
&lt;p&gt;Take a map at the trailhead sign, N 43° 55.870' W 121° 35.877'.
The area has stands of old growth ponderosa and lodgepole pines
amidst interesting lava formations. The trail, rated most difficult
in the second half, is steep and needs at least 2 feet of snow for
good skiing. Check the &lt;a rel="nofollow" href=
"http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/centraloregon/conditions/recreport-bdfr-win.shtml"&gt;
Forest Recreation Report&lt;/a&gt; for current conditions. The terrain
rating is for skiing under good conditions; it could be more
difficult when stormy or icy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The container is a slide box that cannot hold much. It starts
with a log, pencil, Oregon Geocoin (unnumbered to keep) and
Geocaching pin. If you short circuit this winter, find your own
route in the summer along the various roads and snowmobile trails
in the area or go cross-country.&lt;/p&gt;

Just a nice winter hike to get the blood pumping...I can't believe that this cache was last found by Bubblegummers in October of 2009..With all the folks that visit this shelter, thats amazing.  The cache was in good shape, well hidden.  We found a digitialfish in the cache kind of cool.  A TB but of a different sort.  We will take it to Eugene next week.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Headed out to do some caches in the Edison SnoPark area. This was my third and last stop on the trip. Hiked 8.1 miles in 4:03 with total accents of 1065 ft. Was the first finder this year and cache is still in great shape. Some parts of these trails are hard to follow as some of the diamonds have gone missing or are on downed trees. I hiked over from the Edison Shelter and had a trail map with me, but still had a few problems getting from the High Voltage trail to the Direct Current trail for the reasons mentioned above. Tried to come back on the Alternating Current trail but only made it part way before losing the diamonds. Cut back over to the Direct Current trail to finish the hike back. TFTH. SL

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Picked the hottest day of the summer (so far) to make this hike.  No paper x-country maps are available in the summer at the sno-park, and the usual wooden signs with maps have been removed.  So, we took the dusty,hot, rocky motorcycle trails out to near the cache, and the much more enjoyable "Direct Current" trail back to the lot.  We'll come back in the winter with our skis to try again for the cache.

Dad pre-built the AC/DC shelter about 15 years ago at the log building yard in La Pine.  They dismantled the buildings then helicoptered the logs into place for this shelter, one up on Sheridan Mtn., and a few more in the area. I suppose the ski or snowmobile clubs re-erected the shell, then fitted the huts with roofs, benches etc.  Nice place to stop on a cold winter's day.</groundspeak:text>

The bottom portion had lots of downed trees.  Midway up I located some deer trails and used those to make my way to the top.  At the GZ, I searched a bit and finally located the cache on the ground.  The lid was cracked and it looked like something had chewed on the container.  I signed my name and placed the cache back to match the hint.  I made it most of the way down the butte when I heard thunder.  Luckily I got back to the car before the storm arrived, but it prevented me from attempting Kapka butte.</groundspeak:text>

My guess would be sasquatch.  Probably a huge, hairy one --- with an attitude.  Could this be why no-one has logged a find in over a year???  Could it be that they've been eaten???  Is anyone out there missing a caching buddy???  Oh well, not me.  I kept a keen eye out on the way down though.  TNLN  TFTH

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Followed the dirt bike trail for a little while then to the top with lots of stops.  Got to the cache and found it on the ground, wire ripped out and big tooth holes in the lid and on the cache.  Somehow the lid stayed on and all the contents was still safe.  Moments before we got there, I pointed out bear scat to elkjim and he confirmed.  Fixed the cache and put it back on the hanger the best I could.  Next hunter might want to take a new peanut butter jar up and replace.  Still good until winter at least.

Now, where's the next JCT micro?  T4TH</groundspeak:text>

 I have been coming to this area all my life and decided to place a cache in the area;
To share a favorite walking place of mine.


The cache is just a few hundred feet of the trail but it's mostly flat so it should not be that difficult to get to.

the trail starts just off the road at N 44. 08.738
                                                W 121. 25.346

One imagines that they were in just as much awe of the beautiful surroundings as the modern hiker is today.  My hope is that you enjoy the serenity of the rushing water.  Make sure to spend some time exploring the simple beauty of this spot.

Park at the coordinates provided, and follow the small old skid road for a majority of the hike.  As you approach the cache, you'll find the cave to expore first.  Enjoy your visit!

Temporary note:  The Sisters backcountry is usually snowed in this time of year, but due to an extremely warm winter, we were able to make it to this location.  On January 11th, it was 55 degrees and sunny!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Penstemon, aka Beard Tongue: a large group of plants in the
Plantaginaceae family with opposite leaves, two-lipped, variously
colored corolla, and capsules containing many seeds. Can be a few
inches to several feet high. Found across North America in habitats
ranging from open desert to moist forests and up to the alpine
zone, but uncommon within their range.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trail is steep and narrow with some boulder scrambling,
unsuitable for most kids and dogs. It begins from the old Brooks
haul road (gravel Forest Road 4606) and passes interesting cliffs,
wildflowers, and old growth pines and firs. Tumalo Creek passes
tantalizingly in and out of view below, but always within
earshot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several varieties of Penstemon line the trail and are prominent
around the cache site in spring and early summer. The cache is in a
rock wall about 10 feet west of the trail and 4 feet above. Should
be an easy find except the cliffs play havoc with satellite
reception; the west decimal minutes were bouncing around from .909
to .922 for me. You are looking for a round 4-inch metal can known
as a German Army Butter Container.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;TH1V4NP - Trailhead&lt;br /&gt;N 44° 03.109 W 121° 24.719&lt;br /&gt;Trailhead on Forest Road 4606 with parking for a few cars.

When we got to ground zero we actually saw two trucks parked in the area but they quickly left. The find was pretty quick log was dry and everything ship shape. Glad to have the first find of the New Year and reaffirm that this cache is happy and healthy as it enters the season of its availability [:D]</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This cache is best gotten via  Quinn Meadows Horse Camp. The campground is on the east side of the Cascades Lakes highway, between Devils Lake and Elk Lake. The gate might be locked at times but there is ample parking along the gravel road.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Be carefull of the horses that might be in the area. They should have priority out here.

Public access is allowed through this reservation horse campground. You might have to park just outside  the campground sign along the road for day use. 

The TH starts on the far side of the campground at (43 59.769-121 47.102). Follow the trail along  Quinn Creek NE. This creek feeds Hosmere Lake located about about two miles south. There is another trail that leads that way near this TH. Enjoy the babbling brooks and lava formations.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">One of our favorite areas - I Love seeing the waters emerge from the rocks, the little ponds that form, and the creek wandering through the woods and eventually end up in Hosmer Lake!  Great trail too, through the lava.   Unfortuneatly Quinn Meadow horse camp is not open for Day Use - so if you approach from that area you may need to be stealthy with your vehicle.  The gate at the Cascade's Lake Hwy  is locked during the winter season from October to June - adding a little more miles to the short hike.  

Container in good condition, a little damp inside, but here is a whole army  of little green army guys inside  guarding this cache. Thanks Markellie for the nice hide.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Out bright and early this morning to do some caches in the Sheridan Mountain and Kwohl Butte area. This is the second time I have hiked out this road to cache. Last fall there were snow drifts at the cache site and after returning today, I am sure glad I decided not to persue it then. It could have been a long drop with a false step. Was testy enough today without the snow. Parked at the above coordinates and hiked 5.53 miles in 3:20 with total ascents of 1396 ft.

took a bit of looking as my numbers kept me too high up.  finally started thinking of the clue and found it.  weather was real iffy as it was blowing, completely clouded in, raining and then a good snow storm.  walked the rim back counterclockwise to the south where i bailed off.  fun day though!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Cache is located near the summit of Kwohl Butte, hidden within whitebark pines.   

Getting to the butte in summer isn't the easiest and requires some off-trail bushwacking up the cinder cone. Once you get to the base, climbing the cone will find you passing thru ancient mountain hemlock forests that transition into a whitebark pine environment. These whitebark pine groves are only found on high elevation mountain top locations – and Kwohl Butte is unique in having one of the better populations in Central Oregon.

The cache is located along the upper caldera rim.  I hope you enjoy the challenge of getting up here and definitely enjoy the cool environment.  To maximize the views and experience, pick a stunningly clear day for this one!!  

A quickie on whitebark pine:

Whitebark pines, which are one of three five-needled pine species on the Deschutes National forest (sugar pine, western white pine, and whitebark pine) are sadly in decline in throughout it;s range -  the western United States.  Mountain pine beetle outbreaks are decimating many of the large and ancient whitebarks creating forests of bleached skeletons. Of more concern is an exotic fungus (blister rust) that infects whitebark pines which leads to killing the trees. There is concern that blister rust levels are increasing throughout the whitebark’s range leaving the species in peril.  One can observe both beetle kill and blister rust mortality among Kwohl Butte’s whitebark stands.

You’ll most likely encounter Clark’s nutcracker jays up near the summit, particularly during late summer when cones are ripe. These voracious jays have an important role with regenerating whitebark. Whitebark seed is not wind dispersed like most other pine seed. Instead, they require animals and birds to both extract the seed from the cones and plant the seed. Clark’s nutcrackers have evolved with strong bills for cone extraction then “plant” the seed into high elevation seed caches.  Amazingly, months later, the birds can remember most of the cache location for foraging.  That is why most whitebarks are growing in clumps and grow into multiple stemmed trees – cached seed that is missed or displaced.</groundspeak:long_description>

From the 4613 road, took the narrow 300 Road (dirt, single lane, nearby brush) to a small intersection 0.1 west of this cache.  Hoofed on up the brushy road to the mtn. bike intersection and nearby cache.  BaileyBellaBC</groundspeak:text>

from the trailhead along a primitive trail next to Tumalo Creek.</groundspeak:short_description>

align="right" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Oregon lily, aka Columbia lily: Lilium columbianum, a
perennial herb with showy orange-red, purple-spotted flowers.
Native to western North American prairies, thickets and conifer
forests up to 6,000 feet. Infrequently seen in Central
Oregon.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unmaintained trail is to the left of the trailhead for the
Tumalo Creek Trail where an old surveillance sign is posted. It
meanders between the creek and the higher trail to a point just
west of Cruise by the Creek 2, GC63F7, so you could hike a loop of
roughly 2 miles. It is quite steep where it joins the upper trail
and there are a few tree falls. You could also continue upstream on
the main trail to Penstemon, GC1V4NP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will pass through lush areas of dogwood and spirea (blooms
later in the summer) on your way to the cache. The cache is next to
the trail at a spot that is unremarkable except that there is a
beautiful Oregon Lily growing there. You are looking for a 3-inch
plastic jar from Putter&amp;amp;Sassy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: The log sheet erroneously gives the cache name as "Spirea"
which you will also see on this trail.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Drove up on 4613 and then narrow, dirt 300 to a wide place 0.1 mile west of the nearby cache alongside the mtn. bike trail and headed SE 0.2 on the obscure old forest road, hidden by the thick snowberry bushes.  At N43*57.565, W121*31.032, we came across a new mtn. bike trail leading uphill over several rocky drops to the top of Kiwa Butte.  Fifteen year old Bailey made it up with some assist.  Passed a cache of hand tools used to create this new trail, and wondered if this was a maverick trail or one planned and approved by USFS.  There will be plenty of erosion once the rains return to this steep trail.  

Enjoyed the stellar views from the top and could see Thielsen to the South and Tam Rim to the north.  Overall from the rig, 1.6 miles RT and 450 vertical gain.  BaileyBellaBC</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Log jumped and brush dived straight up the hill after the starter cache. Got to the top and found a trail. Most of the nearby mountains greeted me as well as the big dead ponderosa that got hit by lighting. I think I could see the tip of Mt Thieison way down south. The trail is actually a bike trail (of course) that is steep, loose and deep going over boulders. Crazy ride for brave hearts. Walked down a 100 feet or so and jumped off to bushwhack back down. The trail seemed to go not where I wanted to. Love those butte hikes BD. Thanks. Fav.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">So, while preparing for our trip over here for a little vacation (and of course, some caching) - we were looking at Unknowns - our favorites; and for Traditionals, with favorite points.    We found the Bonus cache, and were intrigued.   We had found the original cache:  Dry Canyon Cache on 04/20/02; which was our 23rd cache.   We absolutely loved the walk in the canyon, the tag with the waypoints was so very clever (in our minds).   It has been a favorite of ours for years.   So of course, we needed to do this one too... and with a Bonus to boot!

This cache was the main goal of the day.  We slowly made our way to the first WP, and quickly found the coordinates for the final.    We enjoyed a very pleasant walk - trying to remember how it was before (twelve years ago); and what seemed to be the same.

At ground zero, the gps did want us to look in the wrong place for a while - but when that didn't pan out - we expanded our search and C found the cache tucked away safely.

Thank-You for recreating this experience - we enjoyed it, just as much as we did the first time, 2650 caches later.  [:D]

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Well, I was out for a drive hunting caches and I remembered a nice
little spot for your entertainment.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Enjoy the area but be careful where you go and watch any children
and pets that you may bring with you. You should bring a light or
two just in case you want to explore more. And you just might want
to. It is not going to be that easy for you but you will enjoy the
end result. 
&lt;p&gt;This is a multi stage hunt. You will be out of town in the
puckerbrush and trees and for the final leg, high clearance or four
wheel drive or shanks mare will be needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first stage will involve a hike. As I am bit on the lazy
side where possible, if I can not drive in, you won’t find a way in
either. The first place you need is the “Above” part of the title.
No matter where you park, you will need to go “Above”and look for
the tag. You will be looking for a copper tag with the cache
numbers on it. Hint is below. While here, I crossed a lot of
critter tracks so be on the watch for wildlife. Come in from the
right spot and the hike is longer but real easy and okay for
kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After finding the tag and getting the numbers, you will be
heading for the cache itself. This will be the “Below” part of the
title. The cache is not below but it is close to the “Below” part
of the cache title so think to yourself, what is close to below.
The hint’s for this cache are cryptic but they should do. Hey, I
know there is logging terminology involved but that's my life. Also
just to warn you, The cache container is very well hidden. And on
top of that, the cache container is VERY WELL HIDDEN. The cache
container is a 50 cal. ammo can. Disclaimer: "Cut and Paste" logs
will be deleted without warning. We retain all rights to this
cache. We can and will modify, adjust, tweak, disable or archive
this cache at any time without prior notice. Without prior notice
we can and will delete any log that does not conform to our intent
of this cache hunt . We will not be liable for any direct,
indirect, punitive, or consequential damages you may suffer from
hunting this cache. If you attempt this geocache hunt, you do so at
your own risk. Know your limits and do not attempt to exceed your
abilities.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Hint # 1 :  A hint for this one is where would men sit  in getting their hair cut.  This one is made from Pinus ponderosa.  

Hint # 2 :  You should be able to SNAG (Pinus ponderosa) this one easy.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Happened to pick up my Logscaler TB while in Seaside so decided to make the find on this cache so I could drop it off in one of your caches. Hiked .5 miles in 24 min. for first leg with 186 ft. accent. This stage is still in great shape. Hiked .28 miles in 13 min. for the final stage as the first leg of an 8.1 mile hike on the Edison Nordic trails while doing two other caches (Rigley and AC/DC) in the area. The last stage is in great shape, but hadn't been hidden very well by the prior finder. Tried to make it a lot better hide as described in the description. TFTH.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">You select your starting point, but I would recommend the Phil's trail head parking area located off of Forest Service Road 4604.  The coordinates listed above are for the waypoint.  You will need to locate the waypoint to collect some information.

When you reach the waypoint, you should see a small sign.  Record the two digit identification number from this sign.  Assume that the two digit number represents XX.

Alright, now for some quick math to find the final cache coordinates.

Final Coordinates = N 44° 0A.BBB W 121° CC.DDD

A = XX - 15
BBB = (XX * 21) + 2
CC = XX + 10
DDD = XX * 25

After locating this cache you might also try locating “Lunchtable” (GCG5YJ). When combined with this cache it will make a nice 10 mile loop back to the trail head.

Not only did he solve it from the couch- he "located" it as well. He decided to find it without a gps. First, we went past the first way point ( just to make sure) . Then, when we reached a certain spot, we got off our bikes and found it by walking a certain number of paces one way, turn, then another another way. THERE IT WAS ( well, we searched a tad). Incredible, geocaching from the couch!

Did Highland Walk II, Highland Walk, Skwirl Bounce, COD, Lunchtable, I Want to Ride My Bicycle, Voodoo Red Rocks, No Petticoat Junction, and Kent's Way. Whew. Trails were in beautiful shape, but that might have been a bit of a long ride for the first one of the season. 

Did this one as a traditional, more or less. Figured out the number from the first waypoint by using my mountain bike trail map. Found the cache quickly with good coords. Interesting container. Trails were very busy in this area today. t4tc</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Edited: 6/5/07....Changed containers from tupperware to an ammo can to keep the squirrels from chewing on it :) Start at one of two places.  If you like a nice 10 mile round trip mtn. bike ride go to the corner of elm and tyee at 44 17.044N  121  32.971 W to start.  Otherwise keep driving south on threecreeks rd for another 1/2 mile and turn left on forest rd.4606 and drive to this location a park. 44  15.743 N   121  32.032 W.  The last way is 2 miles closer so would be a 3 mile hike or mtn. bike from there.  I would suggest mtn. biking since it is such a neat trail.  Just follow the bike route trail and about .65 miles into the hike if you take the shorter length make sure you see the sign to turn left(2.65 miles for starting for the longer route).  At 4.1 miles for the longer route or 2.1 for shorter you will go across a red cinder rd.....go straight(it is well signed anyway).  Enjoy the view when you get to the top.  One of the best views of the cascade mtn. range here.  Actual cache is about 10 feet east of the ending cache coordinates because of rocks and a cliff.</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache can be found in a few different ways.   If the water is high enough you can kayak up the stream from Hosmer Lake and find a nice spot to picnic near the falls.  Or you can ride your Mtn Bike on the trail that leads from Mt.Bachelor/Sparks lake to Hosmer.   Or What we did was stay at Quinn Meadow Horse camp for the weekend and rode in from Camp.  Unfortunately Quinn Meadows camp doesn't allow Day Use parking so if you come in from that direction you either need to do it off season (Oct - May) and hike down the road from the locked gate.  Or be very stealthy with your vehicle during peak season - June-September.</groundspeak:text>

align="right" /&gt;Phil's Trail was originally known as Twice-Cut Tree
and was one of the first mountain bike trails near Bend. It runs
through a nice little dry canyon. One way to reach the cache is to
pedal the 3 miles from the Forest parking area (no fee required as
of 2004) at N 44&amp;deg;02.612' W 121&amp;deg;23.168' although there are
many other ways.
&lt;p&gt;Satellite reception is fair to poor but the tree is easy to
spot. After the cache, you can continue for many miles on the trail
system, perhaps hitting several other caches in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

Worth it. I'm glad I read the hint before setting out, my coords were a bit off, and the cache was in the last place I looked. Took the trail back to my car, though, which was fun. Lots of photo ops, glad I took my camera. The cache is in great condition, and the contents are less junk-heavy than most caches. Wonderful! TFTC.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Why do things the easy way? Riding by this one seems easy enough, but the trails, though not officially closed, really shouldn't be ridden during winter. And the closest roads ARE officially closed. Last option? Walking in, of course. But a 6-mi. round trip from Phil's Trailhead sounded tedious at best, so I drove along Cascade Lakes Highway with my GPSr on and the waypoint active until I found the closest point. This turned out to be pretty close to the FR 41 junction, so I parked there. It was a little more than 1.5 mi. to the listed coordinates from here. 

It turned out to be a very pleasant adventure. A forest that would be dusty, hot, and full of people in summer was, well, NOT all of those things today. Absolutely peaceful, a de facto wilderness. The open forest offered very easy walking; at no point did I have to travel more slowly than I would on a well-packed trail. I crossed one forest road and 2 mountain bike trails on the way there. Since the cache was offset from the tree toward the direction from which I was coming, I just used a reverse bearing and waited until in said something close to 70' before I began my search. Had to use some caution clambering about on slippery rocks. Spotted a place that actually made me say aloud, "That's where I would have put it." Just as I was about to move on, my eyes caught the lovely, metallic gleam of ammo can. Contents were in great shape. From inspecting the log, it seems I'm the first person foolish enough to have visited in January. After replacing it, found a flat rock up top where I enjoyed a celebratory lunch before the hike back the car. The walk took about 35-40 minutes each way. T4TC/TNLNSL</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Took the dogs on a walk along the old dry Tumalo Canal from the pond (parking WP). The road is blocked by a big tree at this point. After a mile or so down the dirt road I found this forgotten structure and the rock ridge. This was once a part of the failed Tumalo Reservoir system built about 100 years ago. There is a nice viewpoint about 100 feet east of the cache, next to one of the many horse trails that rope this area.

To get to the parking spot turn off the Tumalo Reservoir road at 44 08.290-121 23.730.

P.S. Dont forget the "Tumalo Canal Confuence" cache if you have not got it yet.

Spent some time exploring the area and had lunch at the Water bridge. Wandered down the canal on the way back to the confluence.  The canals were flowing on the way in, but were dry on the way back out. Don't know how you find these places, but glad you do! Another Markellie Fav. TFTC SL</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">You are searching for an ammo can.

There are multiple ways to get here from road 4613. One of the ways (road 300) you must have no regard for your vehicle's paint job and have good clearance. This is the route we took, and we cleared 2 downed trees from this route for you. It would also make a good route to mountain bike. The family sedan should be able to make it within a 1/4 mile or so using another route.

You cannot drive far past the cache because there is a very large tree over the road that has likely been there for years. If you have a large vehicle, please find a good spot to turn around before the cache, or else you'll be making a tight turnaround in the road.

An acquaintance of mine says he found out about a mountain bike route that goes by here from an "old" (80's?) mountain biking book. We hope that you enjoy this spot!</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">The cache is not at the listed coordinates; you will need to solve a puzzle to find it. I recently made a trip to Corvallis and was amazed at the wide variety of puzzles they have there. I stole this idea from ZSteve, but his puzzle is MUCH harder than this one.
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Kakuro is like a crossword puzzle with numbers. Each "word" must add up to the number provided in the clue above it or to the left. Words can only use the digits 1 through 9, and a given digit can only be used once in a word. Every kakuro has only one solution, and can be solved through logic alone. This is a pretty easy one. They can get insanely difficult.
&lt;p&gt;Solve the puzzle included below, and figure out the values for A-G. Once you have those, subtract 1 from each and plug them in: N 44° 0A.BCD W 121° 2E.FG9. The cache is less than 3/4 of a mile from the listed coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since you worked so hard to solve it, you'll be rewarded with a pretty spot to make the find. You will be looking for a 1" x 3" x 4" plastic container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you get the coordinates, they will lead you to a place where you can go no further. This point is completely accessible by trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, put down the GPS and let the hint take over. You will have to take a few steps off trail to make the find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check your answers for this puzzle on &lt;a href="http://www.geochecker.com/index.php?code=32426d98ef884a19414ba2885e610973&amp;amp;action=check&amp;amp;wp=47433242513356&amp;amp;name=4b616b75726f20696e2074686520576f6f6473"&gt;Geochecker.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Headed out this morning to pick up some of the caches in Bend we hadn't gotten to. This was our second attempt to locate this cache after posting a DNF last December when there was snow on the ground and Mr. Bubblegummer had looked for it by himself. After much crawling through the bushes around downed trees with no success, we tried contacting the CO without success. Had hiked about half way back to the geomobile when he kindly returned our call. With an additional hint, we went back and looked again and finally made the find. Turns out if it had been a snake, it would have bitten us both as we had searched very nearby more than once, just didn't look in the right direction. Without the additional input, we would never have found it as the hint had us looking in all the wrong places. Once it was found, the hint made a little more sense, but not much. TFTH.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">The puzzle wasn't too tricky, but wow, finding this one was tough!  Based on the last few logs, I knew it wouldn't be easy, and it certainly lived up to that.  Actually, most of the hike out to the cache was very nice (though a bit on the warm side), but the last 100 yards or so were much tougher.  After what felt like a 4.5 star bushwhack, I finally made it to ground zero and then just stood there thinking, "Really?  Here?"  But after puzzling over the hint for a minute or two, I made one more push toward a possible hide location.  I feel very lucky that I managed to find it!  I probably could have spent 1/2 hour there and still ended up not seeing it, but fortunately I did catch a glimpse after a bit.  The cache is still there and seems to be doing fine!  Thanks for the fun.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Headed into Bend today to do some caches we hadn't gotten to. This was my seventh stop of the day. After spending some time doing the puzzle because some of the weather has been to nasty to cache, went out and attempted to find this one. Was unable to locate it and the fact that there was snow on the ground in the cache area may have had something to do with that. Spent about 1.5 hours hiking the 2.5 miles R/T and bushwacking while looking without success. Will give it another shot when the snow goes away now that I have the puzzle done. Happy Caching</groundspeak:text>

The first trip we couldn't come up with it - lots of undergrowth and stickers.  After a friendly nudge from the CO, we took a second trip and finally made the grab.  It was only about 2 feet away from our first venture in!  I think this one is safe from being muggled!  Wearing long pants helps.  Thanks for another great brownsbend puzzle cache!</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Nature has rearranged itself a bit at the cache location, so the clue has been altered accordingly. Have my Puzzle Caching elective class coming out here soon and had to make sure it was in decent condition. A bit of moisture in the container, but the log was OK. The container is considerably more difficult to access than before, but careful geocachers should be able to do so without maiming themselves.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The canyon of Tumalo Creek is one of my favorite places to wander, and its three-season accessibility makes it one of the first and last places I visit each season. We are truly lucky to have such a beautiful place to visit so close to town.

By the time you get to this cache, you will have spent a good amount of time in the area. This series was created to be done in one hike. Some trails are easy and flat, some are rough and steep. You'll visit quiet paths through ponderosa, shaded creekside glens, and sweeping vistas. But all of the caches are quite near a trail; cross-country travel might be tempting sometimes when you look where that arrow is pointing, but in places it would be difficult and dangerous. Each cache includes a clear description to get you to the next one. Happy hiking!

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Good Day,

It looks like your cache has been under the weather for some time. While I feel that Geocaching.com should hold the location for you and block other cachers from entering the area around this cache for a reasonable amount of time, we can't do so forever. Please either repair/replace this cache in the next couple of weeks, or archive it so that someone else can place a cache in the area, and cachers can once again enjoy visiting this location.

If the reason the cache is under the weather is something out of your control, such as construction or flooding, please post a note on the cache page with your best guess of when the conditions will improve. If the situation is temporary and is something out of your control, there is no need to archive the cache at this time.

I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to geocaching in the past and am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the future.

Thanks for your understanding - Cheers!

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">In beautiful Shevlin Park on the west side of Bend next to Tumalo Creek. There are several trails and a paved road in the park. When the road is open (usually spring-summer only) you can drive to within a quarter mile of the cache; otherwise, it's a pleasant 2-mi mountain bike, hike or cross-country ski from the parking lot off Shevlin Park Road. Elevation gain from the parking lot is about 150 ft.
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;img src="http://idisk.mac.com/main_street/Public/mtn-bike-friendly-art.jpg" align="right" /&gt;From the parking lot (N 44° 04.966' W 121° 22.694'), head up the canyon by road or trail. The road ends at Fremont Meadow (N 44° 03.714' W 121° 23.763') where the Fremont Expedition camped in December 1843. With enough snow the parks department sets ski tracks on the road.
&lt;p&gt;There are several trails in the vicinity of the cache which is located a few steps off one of the trails. Please stay on trails and don't bushwhack. If you get on the wrong trail, keep going until you get to a junction where you can backtrack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the cache, you can continue up the creek a little farther before the trail exits the park into the national forest. The trail climbs steeply out of the canyon and then continues for miles.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This traditional cache is followed by three bonus caches, which together are designed to guide you through a nice hike in the area of Tumalo Creek Canyon. I hiked 6.5 miles placing the series, but the final bonus describes a shorter way to return to your car.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">When you find this cache, you will find a guidebook. In the first couple of pages of the log, it will tell you how to use that guidebook to find the next cache in the series- and the first bonus- "N.A.S.". It will also describe the best route for you to follow in order to get to that cache. I strongly recommend following the suggested trails throughout this series. Straightline cross-country travel in most places would be extremely ill-advised. Expect mountain bikers, runners, etc., to be sharing some of these trails with you. 

In order for others following you to be able to find the caches in this series, please take neither the guidebook nor the pertinent log pages. You may want to bring a notepad along so you can jot down directions.

For this first cache in the series, begin at the suggested parking coordinates. About 130' west, you will notice a numbered road sign. Your trail begins right next to it. 

This first one has by far the most difficult terrain of any cache in the series, but it's not too crazy. The easiest approach follows the trail to a switchback all the way at the bottom of the rocks, then climbs around the right side of them. A lot of the rocks in this pile are extremely loose, and this approach avoids all that. If you choose another approach, terrain difficulty could get much higher. You are looking for a wide, flat, snap-lock tupperware.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Good Day,

It looks like your cache has been under the weather for some time. While I feel that Geocaching.com should hold the location for you and block other cachers from entering the area around this cache for a reasonable amount of time, we can't do so forever. Please either repair/replace this cache in the next couple of weeks, or archive it so that someone else can place a cache in the area, and cachers can once again enjoy visiting this location.

If the reason the cache is under the weather is something out of your control, such as construction or flooding, please post a note on the cache page with your best guess of when the conditions will improve. If the situation is temporary and is something out of your control, there is no need to archive the cache at this time.

I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to geocaching in the past and am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the future.

Thanks for your understanding - Cheers!

The coordinates for this cache are written on the first and last page of that cache's log book. Also written in that cache are two sets of numbers: N-.XXX, W-.XXX. Replace the last three North and West numbers for the coordinates of vroom, vroom to find the correct numbers for this cache. .370 =N-.xxx and .020=W-.xxx.
This might sound more difficult then it really is. It's easy.</groundspeak:short_description>

With no time constraints, we enjoyed the trek along trails &amp; roads, plus the water crossing (my bruised tail bone wasn't happy having to leap the creek). Quite the view from GZ!

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Good Day,

It looks like your cache has been under the weather for some time. While I feel that Geocaching.com should hold the location for you and block other cachers from entering the area around this cache for a reasonable amount of time, we can't do so forever. Please either repair/replace this cache in the next couple of weeks, or archive it so that someone else can place a cache in the area, and cachers can once again enjoy visiting this location.

If the reason the cache is under the weather is something out of your control, such as construction or flooding, please post a note on the cache page with your best guess of when the conditions will improve. If the situation is temporary and is something out of your control, there is no need to archive the cache at this time.

I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to geocaching in the past and am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the future.

Thanks for your understanding - Cheers!

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">After grabbing N.A.S. I had some time before a date at noon.  I set off to get this one logged.  I only saw one hiker and three cyclists total.  It was a fine day to grab these caches.  I arrived at the cache site after using trails much of the way and then bushwacking the last fifth of a mile.  I made it to the trail described in the cache description.  I looked and looked.  No hint listed, so I looked some more.  I then thought maybe the name of the cache was a clue in a way.  I looked and looked some more.  No luck.  A reminder text came in about my date at noon and I still had to hike out.  Now I was on a time limit.  I had to get this cache found.  Nearly ready to call it, I decided to check the logs and one struck me.  I think it was Slow that made a comment about using a rock in the bend of the trail to sit on.  I scrambled down to the obvious rock and quickly located the cache.  I had about 40' from my GPS zero point for the coordinates to the Southeast.  I used the same rock as Slow and did my homework.  I quickly re-hid the cache that had waited nearly a year for someone to find it and had to begin my extrication.  The last of the series would have to wait.  Thanks for this awesome series and as always a special Mystery Smiley!!

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Donated to the Bend Park District by the Chase family, this former working ranch is located 10 miles west of Bend, south of Highway 20. This site has been used primarily during the annual Pumpkin Festival in October. It has a caretaker's house, an irrigation pond and assorted agricultural improvements and structures. It lies adjacent to BLM land and offers expansive views and the potential for regional trail connections.
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">At the listed coordinates you will find the entrance to this area and a new brown sign.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please park your vehicle by the brown sign.&lt;br /&gt;
No need to be obnoxious and drive any farther.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Pay attention to the brown sign, it has two verticle columns of rules with little pictures to make it easy to understand for those not willing to read. To find the cache container, you will need to work with these pictures.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For the North coords, count the number of pictures on the left column (AA) and multiply it by 10 to get BBB. Add 44 to BBB to get CCC. Now, add CCC to 44.10.042 to get the north coords for the container. (44.10.042 + CCC = 44.10.???) If you were to add all the digits in this coordinate together you should end up with the number 24.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For the West coords, count the number of pictures on the right column (A) and multiply that number by 20 to get DDD. Now add 11 to DDD to get EEE. Now, subtract EEE from 121.24.865 to get the west coords for the container. (121.24.865 - EEE = 121.24.???) If you were to add all the digits in this coordinate together you should end up with the number 27.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now that you have the coordinates to the cache container, enjoy the short walk through the old Chase ranch!

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;"&gt;***NOTICE: AS OF 5/2/11, THE DESCRIPTION BELOW HAS CHANGED.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; BECAUSE OF WORK IN THE AREA, TWO OF THE ORIGINAL WAYPOINTS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED, AND ONE NEW WAYPOINT HAS BEEN ADDED.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; HOWEVER, THE ROUTE OF TRAVEL AND THE FINAL CACHE LOCATION HAVE NOT BEEN CHANGED&lt;span class="GramE"&gt;.*&lt;/span&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;"&gt;You need to gather five numerical pieces of information to determine the cache coordinates.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; There are no puzzles, just basic arithmetic.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt; But you must carefully follow the instructions on this two-mile round-trip tour.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; The cache is at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;"&gt;&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt; N 44° 07.ABC&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt; W 121° 23.XYZ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;"&gt;ABC and XYZ are the sums of numbers you will obtain along the way.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; You can assume the ABC and XYZ totals are zero to begin with.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; All coordinates for waypoints are listed at the bottom of this description.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;"&gt;Turn off &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Tumalo&lt;/span&gt; Reservoir Rd at the ENTRY coordinates.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Suggested parking is at the PARK coordinates, also listed at the top of this page.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;"&gt;Within 200 feet of the PARK coordinates, find a clearly-visible PVC conduit that has “Above Ground and Under Ground Issue No. U___” stamped on it.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Add the three-digit number after the letter “U” to the ABC total.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; You do not have to stand in any precarious places to find this conduit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;"&gt;Also within 200 feet of the PARK coordinates is a clearly-visible &lt;u&gt;20th century&lt;/u&gt; date on a section of &lt;u&gt;concrete&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;u&gt;Raised numbers&lt;/u&gt; are used to denote just the year.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Consider the last two digits of the date as a two-digit number, and add this number to the ABC total.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Be careful to use only the date that exactly fits this description.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Don’t use a date inscribed on any metal.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Just as before, you do not have to stand in any precarious places to see the date.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;"&gt;Continue down the canal road that runs by the spot where you found the above date.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Go past the pond on your right, and keep walking for about half a mile until you reach the WHITE waypoint.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; At this point is a long, thin object that has many letters and numbers printed on it.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Find the four-digit number that is &lt;u&gt;evenly divisible&lt;/u&gt; by 17 (the result of the division may be an even or odd number, but there is no remainder, fraction, or decimal).&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Then consider just the last two digits of this four-digit number as a two-digit number, and add this 2-digit number to the XYZ total.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; (Example: If you found the number 3451 printed on the object, you would add 51 to the XYZ total.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;"&gt;At the GRASSY waypoint, you will turn off the canal road and proceed along an unsigned trail that skirts a grassy area.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; At the nearby LOG waypoint you will find a log that is suitable for sitting down and taking a break.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; There is a sample credit card hidden in one of the cracks of that log.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Multiply the first digit of the account number on the card by 5 and add this to the XYZ total.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; When replacing the card, please be sure a little bit of it sticks out of the crack, so the next &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;cacher&lt;/span&gt; doesn’t need tweezers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;"&gt;Stay on the horse trail(s) until you are within a couple hundred feet of the ROCK waypoint.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Then go off-trail and find a 35mm film canister hidden in an obvious spot at that waypoint.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Inside the canister is a number to add to the ABC total.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;"&gt;Now use the ABC and XYZ totals to find the cache!&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; It’s a &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;camo&lt;/span&gt; plastic container obtained at the “Momma Is Pregnant Again” cache.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; It may be &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;team_triple_threat’s&lt;/span&gt; container, and starts out with a cutely decorated stone in it, along with other assorted items.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;"&gt;Afterwards, if you wish, you can do some more exploring in the area.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; There is another small canal 500 feet south of the cache.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; There are large boulders and yet another tiny stream 500 to 700 feet north of the cache.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; To get back to the parking area, you can either return the way you came or find a shortcut through the brush and the maze of horse trails.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;"&gt;IMPORTANT:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul type="disc" style="margin-top:0in;"&gt;
&lt;li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;"&gt;I have seen dogs here before, but remember this area is popular with equestrians.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;"&gt;This cache has the attribute “Not Available &lt;span class="GramE"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; Winter” for two reasons.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; First, the entry road is closed to vehicles from December through March.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; But even if you walked in, one item may be near-impossible to find if there is significant snow on the ground.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;"&gt;Depending on the time of day and season, there may be &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;mosquitos&lt;/span&gt;, so come prepared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;"&gt;Since the trails in this area are greatly used by equestrians, they can be dusty!&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Wear appropriate footwear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;"&gt;Practice trail courtesy to the equestrians in the area.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;"&gt;Be careful not to cross onto private property if you do further exploration of the area.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

I was originally intending to archive the cache, but decided not to after seeing what a nice area it is. A nicely set up cache, too. Just gotta be good at following directions. Everything was right where the description said it would be.

And the largest canal looked very inviting. Slow, wide, full of water out of Tumalo Creek (I think). I'm sure it's illegal, but BOY would it be fun to float that on a hot day with a few artisan-crafted ales...

Anyways, it's still here, and if you haven't found it yet, come out to do so. There is also room for more caches out here. This is a nice area that deserves more attention. So, t4tc, Me!</groundspeak:text>

align="right" /&gt;This 600-acre regional park is largely undeveloped
with a beautiful creek running down the middle. The park is
officially open from 7 AM to 9 PM although we have been there at
night. The main parking is at N 44&amp;deg; 04.966' W 121&amp;deg; 22.694'
although you could also start at the Shevlin Commons trail parking
lot to the east for a slightly longer route that starts above the
creek and has good mountain views. A paved road into the park is
open sometimes which would shorten the hike. The cache should be
accessible most of the year although winter snow or mud could make
it difficult to reach.&lt;br /&gt;

I've been to this park millions of times but never to this cool spot- that is one of the things I love about geocaching! I have to wonder -  did you know about this spot first or did you find it while scouting for spots? I  had no swag but it could some more and there is only 4 more pages in the log book. While running,  I listened to The 'new' Squeeze CD "Spot the Difference" . They still sound great and Chris Difford's voice is still amazing with the harmony. Favorite for me.</groundspeak:text>

The cache location is fairly obvious, but it will require a little climbing. Look for a standard ammo can.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">There is an ammo can located in the bottom of a small canyon a few miles west of bend waiting for you. Turn north off Cascades Lakes Highway on road 4610 and drive to one of the two given parking spots.
The road is a little rough but I know your geo-rig can handle it.

 Hiking from the first parking spot is shorter and has less mud to drive through in the winter but requires more bushwhacking. The second parking spot is on the C.O.D TH (biking trail) and has a direct route down the little canyon.

Parking #1- 43 59.723-121 25.726
Parking #2- 43 59.959-121 26.049

Your choice.

It's hard to even see when the quality caches are published because of all the series caches that spew out regularly. Cool little canyon that looks like it may get more users soon judging by the flagged trail alignment winding along the bottom. The COD trail is in good condition; saw a few cyclists and runners. The 4610 road was being graded so it should be ready for summer traffic, too. Thanks!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This Earthcache is located at a viewpoint along the Cascade Lakes Scenic Byway. To get credit for this, you will need to read the information sign and take in the view of the many cinder cones surrounding Newberry Volcano.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;h2&gt;Cinder Cone Fields&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cinder cones, also known as scoria cones, can occur alone but commonly occur in groups or fields where dozens to hundreds of cones are found in one area. That is what you are viewing now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standing at the viewpoint, you can see the northwest flank of Newberry Volcano in the distance. Newberry is a large shield volcano that is covered with cinder cones, each of which came from a vent that opened up on the side of the volcano. As many as 400 cinder cones have been identified on the sides of Newberry. For comparison, there are about 300 cinder cones along the edges of the famous Hawaiian shield volcano Mauna Kea, and fewer than 100 cinder cones along the sides of another well-known shield volcano, Mt. Etna in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This large grouping of cones was formed during the 400,000 years of volcanic activity at Newberry. In some cases, “cone crowding” occurred when younger cinder cones formed over the top of older cones, sometimes nearly burying them. The LIDAR image below shows the multitude of cinder cones surrounding Newberry Volcano (the center of the volcano is the caldera with two lakes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/0b3d487f-a597-4d70-8b4f-395ee74104bf.png?rnd=0.6957056" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cinder Cone Shapes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cinder cones are typically formed when runny/foamy molten rock (magma) is spewed into the air during an eruption, and then hardens before falling back to earth as fragments called “cinders”. The bursts of magma usually occur every few minutes until eventually the cinders pile up and create a cone-shaped mound with a bowl-shaped crater on top. Cinder cones usually form rapidly, erupting for days, weeks or months, and when they are done they normally do not erupt again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a distance, the Newberry cinder cones may look fairly similar . . . steep-sided, symmetrical hills. However not all cinder cones are textbook-perfect, oddball shapes do occur. Non-standard shapes include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asymmetrical cone&lt;/strong&gt; – an oval or elongated shape created by cinder build-up on the downwind side of the cone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breached cone&lt;/strong&gt; – an amphitheater or horseshoe shape created when a lava flow breaks out the side of the cinder cone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secant cone&lt;/strong&gt; – a bisected-cone shape created when lava flows break out two sides of the cinder cone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twin cone&lt;/strong&gt; – a double-crater shape created when the position of the underlying vent is altered during the eruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nested cone&lt;/strong&gt; – created when the power of the eruption varies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eroded cone&lt;/strong&gt; – on young cones, a bowl-shaped crater on top marks where cinders exploded from the vent. On older cones the craters have usually eroded away, leaving a smooth top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see some of these non-standard cinder cone shapes in the LIDAR image above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Logging this Earthcache&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please send an email with answers to the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. According to the sign, how often does Newberry Volcano erupt?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. How many years ago did lava pour out of Lava Butte?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Name three of the cinder cones on the flanks of Newberry Volcano.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Klawhop Butte is a cinder cone with two craters. Explain how these might have formed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photos are welcome, but not required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have emailed your answers, feel free to log your find immediately - you do not need to wait for a response. Please do not post the answers to the questions within your log. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Ample off highway parking is available and a trail pass is not required.  As always, it is suggested that you mark your car for the return trip. This is a semi-secluded area, out of the public view.  

The cache contains lots of goodies including some from the original Bounce contest. 

Traveler Sparky the Fireman is guarding the cache!  Tired from 9 -11 and from fighting those fires in Oregon and California, he just wants to travel to all the beautiful places in Oregon for a little R &amp; R.

Be careful out there.  Dogs and princesses might best be left at home for this one.  Good balance and footwork are essential – test every step.  For some reason the GPS goes bonkers here, so the coordinates are simply meant to help you see the summit, not the cache.  When you see the summit, you can put your GPS away.
 
The cache box is located about 40 feet or so more or less, from the summit as perceived from the direction of Bend. Advanced rock climbing skills are not required. The cache is not in the Manzanita.  Look carefully in all the usual places. The cache is in plain view if you are looking in the right direction</groundspeak:long_description>

Yes it is. It is not "Archived".

Please read all of the history of this iconic Geocache. It is a "Difficult", Award Winning Geocache that is actually very simple and quick if you read the instructions, the comments and notes.

It looks to us like you are trying to get rid of any iconic Geocaches that are not cache and Dash. Please contact me by regular email to discuss this. I have a hundred followers going back to 1992 that will be interested in your comments.

No trees were killed to send this message, but a large number of electrons were terribly inconvenienced.

Oh freddled gruntbuggly,
Thy micturitions are to me,
As plurdled gabbleblotchits,
On a lurgid bee,
That mordiously hath blurted out,
Its earted jurtles,
Into a rancid festering confectious organ squealer. [drowned out by moaning and screaming]
Now the jurpling slayjid agrocrustles,
Are slurping hagrilly up the axlegrurts,
And living glupules frart and slipulate,
Like jowling meated liverslime,
Groop, I implore thee, my foonting turling dromes,
And hooptiously drangle me,
With crinkly bindlewurdles,
Or else I shall rend thee in the gobberwarts with my blurglecruncheon,
See if I don't.

First childhood, no limits, no renunciations, 
no goals. Such unthinking joy.
Then abrupt terror, schoolrooms, boundaries, captivity, 
and a plunge into temptation and deep loss.
Defiance. The one crushed will be the crusher now, 
and he avenges his defeats on others.
Loved, feared, he rescues, wrestles, wins, 
and overpowers others, slowly, act by act.
And then all alone in space, in lightness, in cold.
But deep in the shape he has made to stand erect
he takes a breath, as if reaching for the First, Primitive . . .
Then God explodes from his hiding place.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">One waypoint and the cache. Another hide that satisfies my fondness for odd containers. Even though the waypoint is not too far from the highway, much safer parking is available on rd. 4610 just down the hill. A pleasant visit to a section of forest between the current and former alignments of Cascade Lakes Hwy. The container is large enough for a coin. Barely.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">OK. I know what you're thinking. "Multi's are a lot of  work. I just want get to the coordinates and sign the log. And a micro in the woods? That'll be too HARD!! I'll never get good reception!" I deny none of this. If you foresee that this cache might make you voice these types of complaints, you should probably give it a miss. If, however, you possess the determination of a true geocacher, you will find a relaxing walk and relevant clues to compensate for the spotty reception found in a thick forest.

I was being eaten by the year's first mosquitoes as I was placing the waypoint, so I didn't put the usual effort into making sure the coordinates were solid. It will be pretty clear what your target is, though, so it shouldn't pose a problem. The waypoint will give you the coordinates to the final. Don't look to the title for help; it won't mean a darned thing until you find it. The container can be retrieved without moving any logs, rocks, seesaws, or other common forest objects. And there is no need to get neck-deep in vegetation. I CAN tell you that you will feel it before you see it.

At the site of the final, be patient. Whether it's tree cover, minerals in the rocks, or GPS-fogging spells cast by the gnomes, reception acts kind of weird here. During one visit, my GPS said 60' as I walked up to GZ. I set it down and it zeroed out five minutes later. I suggest finding a high spot and letting your signal calm down a bit before beginning your search in earnest. 

As always, I like my caches to be found, so feel free to request assistance if your visit proves fruitless.

Additional Waypoints
</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Waypoint: 
The signal bounces all around. 
Just shake a branch and follow sound.

Final:
Among these woods, this tree is rare.
Yet HERE, one guards the cache with care.

I really loved the waypoint though and was eager to find the final so I could favorite it. Well it turns out that on a night time FTF adventure GPS51111 decided to show me where it was since she had gone back independently and found it. Somehow I always manage to forget the coin I want to stick in it but I’m sure I’ll come by this way again. Favorite from me for such a lovely waypoint.

As with all the caches in this series, rehide it carefully so it doesn't come to the notice of any of the numerous visitors to this part of the forest.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Good Day,

It looks like your cache has been under the weather for some time. While I feel that Geocaching.com should hold the location for you and block other cachers from entering the area around this cache for a reasonable amount of time, we can't do so forever. Please either repair/replace this cache in the next couple of weeks, or archive it so that someone else can place a cache in the area, and cachers can once again enjoy visiting this location.

If the reason the cache is under the weather is something out of your control, such as construction or flooding, please post a note on the cache page with your best guess of when the conditions will improve. If the situation is temporary and is something out of your control, there is no need to archive the cache at this time.

I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to geocaching in the past and am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the future.

Thanks for your understanding - Cheers!

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Not one to leave things alone, I decided to go check on this one after finding Moist Moccasins in fine condition.  I parked on the B-S Logging road near the corner of the private property fenceline.  I followed the fence about .37 miles and located the cache very easily.  Just as Moist Moccasins, I wasn't even able to see the burn area from the vantage here.  I signed the log and did the homework necessary for Two in the Bush.  Today was beautiful.  I was on cache at around 09:00 AM and it was already warming.  It is only supposed to be around 80 degrees today.  I found two in the Bush to not be too far away with a cache in between (I didn't find that one), and with some time to spend before my date at noon. I set off.  Thanks for the Smiley!!  I am grateful this series was unaffected by the Two Bulls Fire.  It would have been a shame.

This cache was moved from its original place since it was too close to the mtn. bike trail and now is in a little more secluded spot. Will replace the paracord with a narrow cable soon but it is easy to operate and please put back how it needs to be. Really like this spot since it is close to the mtn. bike trail and a good place to eat lunch.  While you are at it go on up to the Pederson ridge cache.  Please be quiet in retrieving the cache since hikers and bicyclists might be close.  Cache is a regular ammo can.

I hadn't read the description, so the hide was pretty much the opposite of what I had been expecting.  Anyway, the twinimals got a kick out of it.  Thanks for the fun!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">A pleasant half mile hike to one of the few caches in this area that do not require a kayak or floating device to travel to.  To protect the shoreline and view from the cache area, we encourage you to arrive at the cache on foot rather than from the water.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">"Hosmer Snowbirds Tribute"  is meant as an acknowledgement to the first "snow birds" that return to Hosmer Lake each spring.  Many "snow birds" return each summer to enjoy the fullness of the forests, streams, mountains, and wildlife found on and around this beautiful lake.  We want to especially honor long time "Snow Birds", Max and Nila, for their years of  summer service as campground hosts, "Mayor and Queen", of Mallard Marsh campground on Hosmer Lake.   The year 2012 marks 25 years of friendly service in their many roles as caretakers, housekeepers, tour guides, fishing guides, marina operators, story tellers, historians, and camp hosts.  We thank them for all they have done to keep Hosmer Lake enjoyable for visitors.  The host site is only a short distance from the parking area, stop in and say thank you for a job well done.  They will be glad to hear from you.

   The difficulty rating for this cache is for a find made on a warm summer day.  A "Snow Bird" searching for this cache in early spring or winter will find more severe conditions.   The roads are closed by barricades and snow from fall until spring.  The trails may have snow, ice, mud, and down trees in winter.  Spring and early summer are usually filled with many mosquitos.  Unfortunately the difficulty rating for this cache is not variable and will not take into account when you choose to arrive.  You will only receive the added satisfaction you gain for the increased effort and hardship you endure during the adventure.  Be careful in planning your trip, we do not encourage anyone to travel into this area beyond their skill level for safe winter travel.   

   We would like to extend "first to find" rights to the first geocacher/snowbird to find the cache annually.

Congratulations to:

2012  First, First to Find,    djkfisher     07/02/2012
2013  First to Find              mscs69      06/05/2013

I rode out today and put a replacement out there. This will allow the final to be found. It's a great mountain bike ride or hike. Make sure you get the number off the lid.&lt;/div&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a multicache that begins at the restored &lt;b&gt;Elk Lake
Guard Station&lt;/b&gt;, which was a summer base for U.S. Forest Service
guards and their families for 80 years. It now operates as a
visitor center and is staffed by volunteers. Be sure to tour the
cabin, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
It’s like stepping back in time 80 years. Elk Lake Springs is
also nearby, according to one map.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"&gt;How to get there:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turn off Cascade Lakes Highway at the northernmost Elk Lake
exit. There is a wooden Forest Service sign reading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elk Lake Loop&lt;br /&gt;
Historic Site&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow the signs to the guard station. From the starting
coordinates above, you will need to do some calculations to derive
the next waypoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is not an abundance of hiking trails on this side of Elk
Lake, so you will be following the road from point to point. Yet
another reason to check out the guard station, it’s really
the highlight of this little adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"&gt;Waypoint #1:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this first stop, you will be standing in front of a wooden
sign describing Elk Lake Guard Station. You need to find the
following information from the sign to derive the coordinates for
Waypoint #2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A = Number of words in the first line.&lt;br /&gt;
B = The fourth digit of the year in which the log cabin was
built.&lt;br /&gt;
C = Number of trucks pictured on the sign.&lt;br /&gt;
D = The fourth digit of the year in which the Forest Service
decided to restore the guard station.&lt;br /&gt;
E = The third digit of the year in which the log cabin was
built.&lt;br /&gt;
X = B - D - E&lt;br /&gt;
Y = B - C&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coordinates for the second waypoint are: N 43° 59.XBD, W
121° 48.CYA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To check: A + B + C + D + E = 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"&gt;Waypoint #2:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a bison tube containing coordinates to the
final cache location. It’s off the road and not too close to
any cabins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"&gt;Waypoint #3 - final cache:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drive, walk or bike down the road to the cache. You are looking
for a medium sized ammo can, hidden well away from cabins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the historic guard station!&lt;/p&gt;

I have to confess we didn't realize this was a double until I had opened the bottle (hot day + soft glue + herculean strength = oops!) So then we figured out to use the coordinates for the second.

I was sad to see all the shooting debris and the bodies of two hapless tv sets that had gone to electronics heaven. Walked to GZ and came upon either some kind of homeless camp or maybe base camp for the tv killers. There was a little table and chair, a bag full of some kind of bottles it looked like, some other odds and ends, and I kid you not: a big stuffed lion guarding the place. There didn't seem to be anybody around so I made my find and got out of there as quick as possible. The cache was in good shape and will hopefully miss the eyes of whoever is stomping around up there. TFTH!</groundspeak:text>

Less than 5 miles from the core of downtown Bend, this woodland park offers impeccable diversity, and it is all close to the heart of Central Oregon.  About 4 miles west of  the Deschutes River, You’ll drive down a steep hill, into the Tumalo Creek Basin.  Aspen Hall is on the right(where the weddings are) and the trail heads are on the left, as are the parking lots.</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
Is the city I live in, the city of angels
Lonely as I am, together we cry

I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
I never worried, now that is a lie

I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way

It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
At least I have her love, the city she loves me
Lonely as I am, together we cry

I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way

Under the _ _ _ _ _ _ downtown
Is where I drew some blood
Under the _ _ _ _ _ _downtown
I could not get enough
Under the _ _ _ _ _ _ downtown
Forgot about my love
Under the _ _ _ _ _ _ downtown
I gave my life away</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Take the number and go that many inches (YES, INCHES) southeast or aproximently 135 degrees upslope. You will now be facing a burnt stump about 9 feet high and a squat gnarley juniper just to the left of it. Look in the juniper for the ammo box. 


There is a rock cairn in the clearing that I found while exploring the area. That should let you know your in the right spot.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">So, having found NAVDOG CANYON REDUX, and absolutely loving it - we plug the bonus coordinates into the gps and say WHAT?!?!?  Gesh, just when you start to assume that people will do things the easy way, the lazy way.   We look at each other - and say HECK! yes!   Off we go (no the way we had anticipated) - but off, never the less.   Most of the time we are on a trail, and occasionally R wanders off and has to regain the trail.   Oh yes, and we walk some more.

We get to ground zero and look about, here and there... it's a regular - oh where can it be hiding.   We peek at the hint, and try looking every where that would work - even thinking outside of the box.  Hmmm - ok, pull up the cache page on the phone (THANKYOUAPP) and check to be sure it's still active, no DNF's - and... oh yes, what does it say here on the cache page - do this, do that, go here... OK!  off we go again - and find the cache quickly this time.  [;)]  Ah, yes - those pesky details.

We had worried about these caches.  You know when you have so much fun and enjoyment... and try and recreate that experience - sometimes it just doesn't have the same impact?  Well, let's just say, you took the experience to a new level - and we enjoyed this just as much as the original one.   The things we saw along the way, the places you showed us - all very nice and rewarding.  Loved it.  Thanks!  Now, can you get us air support out of here??

align="right" /&gt;The C.O.D. Trail runs parallel to Century Drive for
over 9 miles and provides a variety of riding, from easy to
advanced, with many loop options from one hour to all day. Trail
maps are available at bike shops and the Forest Service office.
&lt;p&gt;For hikers, there is a trailhead at N 43&amp;deg;59.831' W
121&amp;deg;24.193' across the highway from the Forest Service parking
area (fee site). There is also a map posted. If you don't want to
leave your georig at the trailhead, you can poke around the maze of
forest roads and get quite close, but I'll wager that it's faster
walking to the cache.&lt;/p&gt;

The container is a large-sized nut jar, adorned in a way typical for my caches. You will not be able to see it without moving something, so please rehide it in a like manner. If you're having trouble due to the "cylinder effect", trust the hint. Although the site holds many places from which it would be unpleasant to fall, neither the approach nor the find require that you traverse anything sketchy.

As we are finally home and able to log our caches since we were relying on minimal cell charge phone battery to store the coords for all the caches. I was looking at the map and I noticed a cache past this one that I didn't know about... Apparently I moved the next one to the "found" folder without knowing...

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">The Western Juniper grows slowly and trees can live over 1500 years. It’s mostly at home in areas of scant rainfall and in shallow, volcanic soils that would drive a normal tree to higher ground. Nowhere is it more abundant than in Central Oregon, where it grows on about 3 million acres, in varying densities.

The female cones, often called "berries," are an important food source for birds and small mammals, especially during the winter.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The first stage of this 2 part cache will be the most difficult. You will need to have your thinking cap on and notice that which is not natural. On part 1 are the coordinates for part 2 - the final cache. This camo container will hold small trade items or travel bugs.

There is a film canister full of beads in the final cache for FTF.

You can access both stage one and stage two by roads - no major bushwacking needed.

Congratulations to Brownsbend and Hikecraterlake for FTF! Brownsbend really had to work for that one!

SignaltheFrog and I stopped for this last cache before heading over the pass through the snow (surprise!) to home for the night.  We had finished our business in Bend and were in search of a cache large enough to hold a TB I was trying to get moving.  We had tried three other caches with no luck.  Thankfully, this one was big enough, though barely, with that huge pad of a log in there!  Signal spotted both stages, and we were on our way.  The numbers on the first stage could maybe use a little refreshing, some of them are getting a bit iffy.  Thanks 4 the cache!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This one is stashed up high in the rocks near a fun little place to go for a day of rock climbing.  Mostly bouldering, but you could do a little top rope, too.  You don't need to be a climber to find the cache though, but if you are, you might find it a little more fun to come up from the bottom.  If you're not, then come find it from the top.  It is only about 300 feet more to walk around to the top of the bluff.  You can even use the road with the Forest Service gate on it to make it really easy.  The cache is on the edge though, so be a little careful.  I did hide it with a dog in tow and on a leash, so its not to hard and I did the climb as well in my hiking shoes, so it's not exactly expert level either.

If you are a climber and want to see more rock faces, set your next Geocache to be Cache On Delivery (N 44*00.562, W 121*24.124) and follow the bluff until you get there.  The Wedgi Creek Bouldering site runs for about 300 feet. Then, if you keep following the bluff, there are several other smaller faces you can climb as well.</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>About twenty feet from the bottom or five feet from the top.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;span&gt;Another addition to our Oregon Fire Lookout list and an addition to the possibilities for the &lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=b65a315f-c7a3-46f0-b2bb-4dca07411862"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Oregon Forest Fire Lookout Challenge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">There is nothing left of the original fire lookout that was on top of Tumalo Butte, now it is all private property with a big house within feet of the original tower.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Started as a camp in the 1930s, a cabin and 10' pole tower w/ 7x7' cab were added in 1950. These were replaced by a 3-story enclosed tower with ODF cab in 1957. It was destroyed in 1981.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt src="http://www.firelookout.com/or/tumalobutte1953.jpg" style="width:379px;height:414px;" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;DO NOT DRIVE UP LOOKOUT DRIVE, this is a PRIVATE road with no access to the cache. Access to the cache is up Saddleback Lane, NOT lookout Drive. Anyone driving on Lookout Drive will be trespassing as the signs at the bottom of the hill indicate. Property owners on Lookout Drive have complained to Groundspeak about trespassing cachemobiles, PLEASE pay attention to your approach and respect private property!&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a small rubbermaid and is within a tenth of a mile from the original tower site. If you drive to the end of Saddleback Lane, at the top the turn around circle is 518 feet from where the tower once stood. It was snowing and windy when we placed this cache so I hope the coords are close enough. The container is at the base of a small Juniper tree. Please re-hide well to keep this one from being muggled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;

It certainly was quite the hike up, although I think that we at least took the easiest route up (there were certainly plenty of other routes which would have been a lot harder)!  Bad weather was approaching, so we quickly grabbed the caches up here, hoping we could get back down before the rains started.  Loved the prop you had set up for this cache, and we hope it survives the winter.  This would be the first of many BAD DOGS caches we would visit this trip.  Thanks for putting out all the great caches!  Since there aren't a lot of visitors to this cache right now, we decided to rescue the TB, so it wouldn't get stranded for the winter.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I was walking out to check on my Presidents' Day cache, and when I got there, the entire area had been defoliated by a brush mower. Including the bush under which I had hidden the cache. After I found a new place for that cache, I decided to place one not too terribly far away in a place that they'll NEVER mow.

Despite the cache name, you are not looking for an egg. The container is a 4.5"x2" cylinder, but that knowledge won't help you until you find it.</groundspeak:long_description>

This can be a long or short hike, depending upon how far your rig will go along the dirt road.  We made it a nice 1.5 mi round trip by parking at the dirt bike lot.</groundspeak:text>

I've had it solved for a while but we finally drove out to the area today and took the cache hounds for their daily walk and found the cache. It was a really easy find. I wish I had looked at the picture of the hiding place before we went out because it is missing the pine cone camouflage. We would have put some pine cones back on it if we had realized.

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The FTF competition has revealed the true nature of some competitors. They relentlessly assimilate your new caches. They come at all hours without stopping to sleep or eat. A few moments to regenerate and they are off to absorb the next new series put out by an unsuspecting cacher. Their appetite is insatiable. They will beat you. You must comply. Resistance is futile.

The ground was still nice and frozen, making for an easy walk out to this cache.  Thanks for giving us some beautiful views and wonderful exercise! Our son scraped his shins on some rocks while searching for this one.  Oh, well.  We found it anyway.  This was a great area!</groundspeak:text>

It is definitely a steady uphill climb to the top of the crater over plenty of blowdown and soft stuff. You will get a workout on this one.

The log book was really soaked so I put in a new log page in a small ziplock bag.
TNSL Left my card.
The container can be repaired with some 2" wide tape.
I decided not to go for the other lonely cache out here since it was too far down over the wrong side of the mountain.

For instance, if I gave you "throw unneeded events", you could rearrange the letters to get "two-hundred seventeen". (Three digit numbers will include the word "hundred".) You get the ripe cut, er, picture at this point, so here are your coordinates. Start rearranging.

N (to the ferry)° (if they gift).(they rent two unhindered)
W (noteworthy nun needed)° (went to fury).(drew food unhurt)

Since there are two possibilities each for the hundredths digits, that gives 4 possible combinations of coordinates. The correct ones will add up to 794. Also, consider that the terrain rating is NOT a 5, nor is "boat" listed under attributes. Narrows things down quite nicely.

The container is currently a small. It is no longer hidden in the same place it was previously, but is within a couple of feet. Use the hint.  Muggles can sneak up on you pretty suddenly here, so be sneaky and/or patient if the situation requires it.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well even though we are young we did not "GO UP" as we were starting to get a little tired from the long hike yesterday and then waking up and hiking the lucky lake caches this morning. With the feet a little sore and many miles left to walk to get back to camp we decided to be smart and not go up. Plus I did not have a cache container to place one up there ;) Lets be honest that is probably the main reason we didn't go up. As for this cache it is a DOOOOOZY of a find. GPS is useless because of bounce. We had about 15-20 m off for the majority of the time. We got lucky that by this time I had started to get a feel for how the CO hides these and so I got inside the mind of my prey and expanded my search. After a while I had the cache in hand and we were signing another {*FTF*}! Thanks for the adventure tired feet included!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The two Bad Dogs caches at the top of this cinder cone have been on our radar for awhile.  On a beautiful 75-degree Central Oregon day we decided to tackle them....perfect.  However, there is no trail but perhaps faint footsteps from the few previous cachers who have gone &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up From Here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;...no other reason to ascend this cone that is a steady upward climb over blowdown and forest debris.  The journey to &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up From Here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is just a small sample of what awaits you beyond...so don't stop here...keep going...you'll be glad you did.  (Up From Here is a small lock-and-lock container.)&lt;/p&gt;
NOTE: As you approach the hill to the cache, don't get too eager and start up the hill too soon. Walk a little further toward the quarry and you will see the logical approach (where a few others have trod before) to Up From Here. Congratulations to Slow&amp;amp;Velvet for First to Find!

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is a favorite campground when the water level is high enough. There is a pretty lagoon that enters the main body of Elk lake for some nice water craft action. Sandy beaches also make for a great swimming area.

At the group site area walk up the hill between camp spots #26 and #27. The cache is in a clear tuperware container with black tape around it and a green lid.

We really enjoyed our time on the trails here. I had seen a bunch of unfound caches around the area and we were hoping to snag a bunch of FTFs and we were not disappointed. This was our target for this hike. Got here after a nice walk, unfortunantly we didn't see any wildlife. Saw a couple frogs at GZ as we were finding the cache and taking a snack break. Signed the log for another {*FTF*}. Thanks for helping us take a nice hike today!</groundspeak:text>

&lt;br&gt;
A little known landmark on the west side of town. Who know's why,
and better yet, why here? But the end result is a fantastic view of
more than just Thom's family!

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATED 4/16/06 TO A PROJECTION CACHE WITH A NEW
CONTAINER PLACEMENT!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
A fairly short projection cache ending up on a ledge with a
fantastic view looking east. There is a little climbing &amp;amp;
bushwacking involved, but not bad. After all, we sure would not
want to scuff up members of the family tree. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
From the above location, which should be rather obvious once you
get there, your mission is to project a waypoint of 515 feet at 321
degrees magnetic. There are a couple ways to do this, one being a
straight forward projection. The other would be a reverse direction
in which you would walk until your gps said 515 feet at 141 degrees
magnetic. That would be the bearing and distance back to Thom's
family from the actual cache location.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Watch the little one's, the first step
off the ledge is a big one.&lt;br&gt;
 The fall would not be that bad, but the stop at the bottom would
really hurt!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Well, I gave it a visit anyway, but the log book is still pretty damp and could stand to be replaced.  I let it air dry for a little while, but didn't have a suitable replacement on me.  Great cache though, thanks.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Found it right at sunset and it was beautiful!  Had a little trouble figuring out how to calculate the correct projection but managed just fine.  I figured out that I had adjusted toward west and not east but didn't feel like doing the projection again so I just estimated the same distance in the opposite direction and figured it out from there.  Isn't it kinda funny when your intuition kicks in and you just know you're in the right spot? Like somehow that last spot on the cliff with nearly the same view could have been it, but no it just didn't feel right.  But this spot... this makes sense. Anyway, thanks for the cache!  As others have said the log is pretty wet and the cache itself is a bit rusty and isn't sealing very well.  Might be a good idea to give it a new container and/or baggie before winter.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This cache has been on our radar for a long time and we finally made the trek today. Slow took his compass to do the projection and got us to the top of the cliff. We looked around in several likely places but didn't find the cache so I looked through the settings on my GPS to figure out how to change it for what was needed and soon had us at the reverse projection listed we found the cache. Unfortunately, it was quite wet inside. We dried out the cache container and let the treasure and log sit in the sun while we watched bikers on the trail below. We read through the log book while drying off the pages but we couldn't stay long enough for it to completely dry. It's just slightly damp. We left the treasure that we were able to dry off but there were 3 items that were completely saturated and not something I could dry on my shirt tail so we took them out. We also retrieved the 2006-California Geocoin (copy) and are drying it out at home before sending it on it's journey.

Lonely cache, cache maintenance, good hike up the cliff and good view. What more can you ask for? We enjoyed it. Definitely left the cache hounds at home for this one. Thanks for the find and the opportunity to learn something different on my GPS. We gave it a favorite point.

Current contents of cache - 3 tubes of beads, plastic coin, plastic bug, and a blow up ball/balloon thingie all dry at this time, a very slightly damp log, pencil, pencil sharpener, 2 pens that actually work.</groundspeak:text>

Drove out and walked up to the cache from below. Saw someone out mountain biking with their dog. Again some wonderful Bend weather was occurring so it was sunny and just gorgeous for caching. Found the cache without any difficulty and everything was in great condition. Almost wished you’d used a bigger container so you could have categorized it as large [:P]

No trees were killed to send this message, but a large number of electrons were terribly inconvenienced

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache had been placed for those trying to get the 31 Souvenirs in August 2013. I thought I'd add some easy ones. If you are a cyclist, this is an easy one to get while on a ride, even with cleats. As you approach you may think you know just where to look but…. I couldn't make it that easy, so you'll need to walk just a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;
Congrats to ganz genau on the FTF Hat Trick!

Actually I might have said that out loud, but since nobody was around, it didn't make a sound.  I paused for a while on the rock overlooking the blue lagoon and thought, "cool place to meditate!"  Then I waded through some rough manz and thought, "this isn't cool."  Everything was cool again when I got to the cache "hey, I can see Homer's Home from here."

A fantastic hide...Thanks.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to &lt;i&gt;The Lair&lt;/i&gt;, a 35-acre mountain bike park where
you--or your kids--can practice advanced bike handling skills. It
is designed with flowing trails of curves, jumps, steps, rocks,
drop-offs and wood ramps. More are planned. The trails start and
end in the open staging area. The park is a joint project of the
Central Oregon Trail Alliance and the Deschutes National Forest.
Many volunteers have contributed to the on-going effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is--what else--a bicycle water bottle. There is an
unactivated surfer geocoin for FTF. Take a breather, enjoy the
view, and on the way &lt;i&gt;DOWN&lt;/i&gt; stop to visit &lt;a rel="nofollow"

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Freeride:&lt;/b&gt; Freeride is a relatively new discipline of
mountain biking, combining different aspects of the sport such as
downhill, dirtjumping and trials. The term is a derivative of
freeriding, which originally came from snowboarding and is used in
other sports including skiing and windsurfing. The original concept
of freeriding was that there was no set course, goals or rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Getting there:&lt;/b&gt; Several bike trails lead to the park. If
you drive, there is a small parking area at the end of a narrow,
dirt road (see additional waypoints) from the north. A poor forest
road also connects with Century Drive from the south. The forest
roads are occasionally closed to motor vehicles. The Tetherow Golf
Resort Community is a quarter-mile to the east but discourages
parking on their streets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK1FDYY - Parking&lt;br /&gt;N 44° 01.573 W 121° 22.359&lt;br /&gt;Small parking area about 2 miles south of Skyliners Road. Take paved Forest Road 4604 past Phil's Trailhead to gravel road on left and then dirt road on right.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was on my list for get before it snows and well it snowed today… go BEND! Well I still managed to get it but I nearly froze one of my hands off and I’m sure it look longer because of the swoosh being covered in a dusting of snow. THANK YOU FOR THE PICTURE! If I hadn’t had that picture of the swoosh I don’t know what I would have done so that was a life saver! (man I’m using a lot of ! in this log…) well I was texting GPS51111 for help the whole time and that is really what froze my hand because touch screens and gloves only mix so well. Saw a biker riding the hills and having a blast. Got the cache with a burst of elation at finding it and at only slipping 3 times and none of them killed me [:D] glad I got this before real snow happened.

No trees were killed to send this message, but a large number of electrons were terribly inconvenienced</groundspeak:text>

Sadly, dirtworshiper  hid it way harder than it needed to be, but pf course you had a perfect hint. Google  Earth with the Phil's overlay  has been helpful to start finding these lonely hides.

of Bend. The cache is an ammo can about 10 minutes from the parking
lot (posted 6 AM to 10 PM, Forest Pass required) and a short ways
from the trail.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;img src=

align="right" /&gt; This makes an excellent mountain bike ride from
Bend (about 15 miles round-trip) or a hike from various access
points (Forest Pass required May thru October at closest parking).
The narrow trails get crowded on summer weekends. You can combine
this with several other caches along the river.
&lt;p&gt;Reception drifts in the trees. The posted coordinates were
averaged 20 minutes and fall in the center of several other
readings so they should be close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pill bottle hidden to be found on a snowy day, pencil included. Stealth is fairly important as there may be lots of muggles around here on school days. Meant to be easy for the winter months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3rd in the series. The whole point being that for those crazy cachers (myself included) who are trying for a caching streak of multiple days, weeks or months snow can be the bane of our existence. All these caches are placed near roads that should be cleared when there is snow and they will all be winter safe, no looking in rocks or on the ground. Note that this location is close to a school, I have kept them far enough away that no one is going to look like a pedophile but do try and not draw attention to yourself. To everyone else these will just be some easy caches in trees but I hope they help to save someone's streak &lt;img src="http://www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile.gif" border="0" align="middle" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always cache in trash out! Be safe, don't do anything you don't feel comfortable with and good luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6em;"&gt;P.S. I would love feedback on the helpfulness of hints, the accuracy of ratings or anything else that you can think of that would improve the experience for those after you&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Cache is located near the beginning of the the trail system and will hopefully encourage you to continue along the Peterson Ridge and Eagle Rock loops that make up a fun trail system right on the edge of Sisters. It consists of the easy, 5.5-mile Eagle Rock Loop and the moderate, 16-mile Peterson Ridge Loop. The latter is a combination of single and doubletrack that winds through Douglas fir, old-growth juniper, and ponderosa pine. The multi-use trail is well marked. Maps along the trail denote levels of difficulty and specific uses. Its a wonderful kid-friendly walk/hike/bike ride in this glorious forest.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“An Afternoon with Rush”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Yarzo Spätzflute&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a kid growing up in the suburbs- a kid with a penchant for Math and fantasy novels- Rush was right up my alley. They were loud. They were amazing musicians. And though I loved Led Zeppelin, I found it impossible to relate to the actual members of the band on a personal level. The brazen confidence of Robert Plant strutting shirtless across the stage, the drunken excesses of John Bonham, the dark mysticism of Jimmy Page… these just weren’t characteristics I could easily relate to as a gangly, awkward teenager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Rush… they seemed like regular guys. Guys with incredible musical skills and lots of long hair, but still regular guys. I could picture sitting down for a burger with them. And everybody loved Led Zeppelin, but being into Rush made you feel… different. Zeppelin fed my visceral instincts, but Rush made me feel like being an intellectual geek could be pretty cool, too. And they could rock just as hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now that I’m older- and they’re older- I recently got to make a dream come true: sit down for a burger with Rush. And a couple of beers. They are Canadian, after all… With Rush coming to Portland on their recent tour, I got in touch with their management and set up a meeting at the Deschutes Brewery Portland Public House. Bassist Geddy Lee and guitarist Alex Lifeson were able to attend; the ever-shy Neil Peart was going to be touring the Columbia Gorge on his motorcycle and wouldn’t be able to join us. The following is a transcript of our conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YARZO SPÄTZFLUTE: Welcome, readers. Let me set the scene for you: I’m here with Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson from Rush, who have graciously agreed to meet for a couple of beers and conversation about rock and roll. Good afternoon, gentlemen, and welcome to Portland!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ALEX LIFESON: Wait… a couple of beers? You said as many as we wanted…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GEDDY LEE: That’s it, Alex… let’s go…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YS: (laughs) Wait, wait… consider the tab bottomless. You might want to try the fries, too… they’re pretty amazing. But we don’t put mayonnaise on them like you guys do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GL: I believe you’re thinking of Belgium…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AL: Yeah, we put gravy on them, not mayo. It’s called poutine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YS: Yeah, ‘cause that’s a MUCH healthier alternative. How do you guys stay so thin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GL: By not eating poutine. Beer, though… that’s another issue. And this stuff is pretty darned good. Hope your magazine has a deep expense account…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YS: Deep like the ocean. So. Let’s get down to business. First, let me congratulate you on your recent induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, followed closely by the release of &lt;em&gt;The Complete Mercury Years&lt;/em&gt;, a re-release of your first 15 albums up through A &lt;em&gt;Show of Hands&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GL: Thanks… we had pretty much given up on the whole Hall of Fame thing. It wasn’t going to change what we were doing as a band anyway, but I guess they finally came to the realization that we were cool enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AL: …and the Complete Mercury Years release is nice. Established fans probably already have most of the albums, but it’s a great way in for people who are giving us a listen for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YS: So, let’s say I’m one of those new listeners, someone who’s decided to give Rush a chance, and I’m putting on your first self-titled album from 1974. What song would you recommend they listen to first to get a good idea of who you were at that time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.cygnus-x1.net/links/rush/images/albums/rush-cover-s.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AL: 1974… Holy crap, that was 40 years ago. Geddy, we’re old…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GL: (laughs) I was thinking the same thing. That’s a good question, Yarzo… because what I really wouldn’t want them to go to first is one of the better-known songs. Too many people know only our “hits”, if that’s even the right term for a band like us, and they never get to hear the other songs that never achieved that status. So I’m going to go with “Here Again”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AL: I like that choice… John Rutsey, our first drummer who only appeared on that album, had a real nice groove on that song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GL: But I’ll admit my vocals were pretty over the top. God, I wish I could still sing that high. Getting old is depressing… where’s the waitress? I could use another Red Chair. This beer is really good… can we move here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YS: I don’t think anyone would complain. And that’s a really interesting song choice. A pretty un-representative song if someone were to ask, “What does Rush sound like?”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GL: Yeah, the whole first album sounds separate from the rest of our catalog. When Neil arrived for &lt;em&gt;Fly By Night&lt;/em&gt;, his lyrical prowess- and of course his drumming- allowed us to go in directions we wouldn’t have considered before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AL: You know, I kind of like that question- what would I want a new listener to hear first off a particular album. Can we do that for each album? I don’t want to hijack your questions…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YS: I’m flattered that you would assume I prepared questions in advance. Sure, let’s do it. So, Alex, since it piqued your interest, what song would you choose for &lt;em&gt;Fly By Night&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://inawhiteroom.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/fly-by-night.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AL: “By-Tor &amp;amp; the Snow Dog”, for sure. One of our most un-self-consciously geeky songs. If they can dig that, they’ll like us across the board. If it turns them off, then maybe we aren’t for them.&lt;/p&gt;
GL: …and at this point in our careers we can say that. It’s not that we don’t want people to like our music; it’s just that we’ve been through enough- and know ourselves well enough- to know that not everything we do is for everybody.
&lt;p&gt;YS: …which provides us a perfect segue into the third album, the oft-vilified &lt;em&gt;Caress of Steel&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fa/Rush_Caress_of_Steel.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AL: Now I need another beer…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GL: Yeah, every stage of that album… writing, recording, release, touring… it was just crap. Not the album itself; I still have a strange fondness for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YS: A face only a mother could love?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AL: Yeah, but it really isn't that bad of an album in retrospect, it’s just that the critics and the record industry people HATED it. Like, with a really out-of-proportion sense of cruelty. I mean, we were just kids then…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GL: Yeah, now we now it was pretty decent, but back then, we were devastated. We just thought we sucked after we saw how people received it. It also had the misfortune of being preceded by a really incredible album. Sort of the middle child syndrome…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YS: So, here, you’re probably wanting to choose a song that will let people see the album you thought you had released, before the backlash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AL: Exactly. I think I’d choose… well, I know Geddy pointed out the benefit of lesser-known songs, but I’ve gotta say “Bastille Day”. Where else in rock and roll can you hear a line like, “La Guillotine will claim her bloody prize!”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GL: That’ll work. I’ll freely admit neither of the long tracks on that album was pulled off as well as they would be in later albums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YS: Like on &lt;em&gt;2112&lt;/em&gt;, where you basically told the record company, “Screw off! You don’t like long tracks? Well, here’s one that’s a whole album side!!”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c9/Rush_2112.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AL: That was such a risky maneuver. But we basically thought we were dead as a band, so we might as well be true to ourselves and go down in flames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GL: Which makes it sort of ironic that the same record company that told us we were idiots is now enthusiastically releasing our first 15 albums…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YS: I would say ‘don’t bite the hand that feeds you’, but they’re not your record company anymore, so who cares? On this one, you’ve got to pick the title track, right? I mean, I know you said you wanted to direct attention to some less-appreciated tracks, but… “2112” is one of the most classic tracks in hard prog rock ever released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AL: Yeah, I’m sure Geddy feels like I do, but I’m intensely proud of that track, looking back from the vantage point I have now. And it’s really aged well- not all of our older stuff has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GL: Very much so. That was the beginning of a great period for us musically. Except for those embarrassing robes and kimonos we wore for a couple of years. I’d like to forget that part…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YS: OK, we’re up to the fifth album… not your fifth studio album, but your first live one, &lt;em&gt;All the World’s a Stage&lt;/em&gt;. Not a lot of musicians throwing around Shakespeare references in 1976…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a0/Rush_ATWAS.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GL: And some people- our detractors- see that as an affectation, like we’re trying to make ourselves look literate. Look… Neil was our idea guy- IS our idea guy- lyrically and in terms of titles, and he wasn’t trying to appear literate. He just WAS literate. That’s the way he talked, constantly making references that Alex and I were too dim to understand until he explained them to us. And it really is the perfect title for a live album…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AL: We were really nervous to release a live album, but at the time, it was exactly what we needed to do. We had just had our first monstrously successful album, and this made a nice division between our earlier material and what followed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YS: And the song you choose here should be pretty interesting. They’d all been released before, so I’m guessing your choice will be based more on the performance than the song itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GL: Exactly. I’m thinking… (looks at Alex) I’ve got to go with the third track, where we do a medley of “Fly By Night” and "In the Mood". Two really different songs that shouldn't have worked well together, but did. Alex is getting a really filthy sound from his guitar, and it all seems more pure without all the overdubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AL: And it’s great for showing people, “Yeah, Geddy really can sing and play those incredibly complex bass lines at the same time, live.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GL: Thanks, buddy… here, have a fry. Are their burgers good here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YS: Oh, absolutely. I need something to balance my next pint, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AL: OK, let’s turn the tables for a second. Now that we’ve got you loosened up with a couple of IPAs, what song would you pick from &lt;em&gt;A Farewell to Kings&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1e/Rush_A_Farewell_to_Kings.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YS: OK…(long sip) I’m going to say “Closer to the Heart”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GL: C’mon, I thought you didn't like the obvious choices? We've actually gotten a bit tired of playing that song, but people always want to hear it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YS: Which is exactly why I'm picking it. If you listen to it with the ears of someone who had never heard Rush before, it’s a really unique song. It's got a little bit of everything that you were doing at that time, wrapped up in the package of a really enjoyable song. Along with the positive message in the lyrics- some of Neil's best- it provides a perfect example of who Rush was at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AL: Man, you know our music better than we do. Will you write our band history?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YS: Yes. Yes, I will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GL: OK, I see where you’re coming from. It’s always interesting to hear others explain their appreciation for one of your songs that you’ve stopped appreciating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AL: What album are we on now… &lt;em&gt;Hemispheres&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ5rwHK_9lgUhSunyujV1rOjH85mTZsSEEdNHGCAELkZS1Xs62REX50Pgs4" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YS: God, I love that album… sorry, I shouldn’t be such a fanboy when I’m interviewing you, but it’s hard for me to remain objective about this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GL: Yeah, we get people telling us this is their favorite fairly often. It’s a difficult album to love, but those who love it do so pretty strongly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AL: But holy hell, it was a stressful album to make. I really don’t remember that one being a fun process. Perhaps the only song on there that doesn't succumb to our desire for excess is "The Trees".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YS: Is that song what you’d want someone to hear first?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GL: Oh, yeah. I like what we did there; it’s really an impressive piece of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AL: If he does say so himself…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GL: Hey, you wrote it, too…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YS: So do the difficulty and the excess of that album explain the significantly more accessible sounds on &lt;em&gt;Permanent Waves&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.supernaturalresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/rush_-_permanent_waves_harlot.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AL: Very much so. We really wanted to retreat from the bloated, over-worked tracks we had just completed and do something more direct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GL: And that choice really seems to have been a good one. It seems like most people consider &lt;em&gt;Permanent Waves&lt;/em&gt; our first “great” album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AL: …and I’ve got to break the rules again and choose a popular song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YS: You’re going to choose “Spirit of Radio”, aren’t you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GL: “Rush does reggae” still sounds like such a horrible idea on paper…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YS: …but it’s not like the whole song is reggae. And it works! Not to mention the beautiful lyrics by Neil. Such a powerful message about the power of music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AL: Yeah, I remember being pretty blown away by that the first time he shared the lyrics with us. I was thinking, “Man, we have to write some pretty incredible music to stand up to those words.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GL: And with &lt;em&gt;Moving Pictures&lt;/em&gt;, we just kinda continued in the same vein. Usually, we don’t like to have two consecutive albums that tread the same territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://radiopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/rush-moving-pictures1.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AL: But it was new territory for us, with lots of room in it. We felt excited at what we were doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YS: …and it showed. I’m eager to hear what you pick from this one…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AL: Ooh, boy. Tough one. This is probably where your readers will disagree with us most. Fans have pretty strong opinions about the tracks on this album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GL: How about “Red Barchetta”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AL: Yeah, that’s a good choice. If someone hears that and doesn’t like us, I don’t think there’s anything we can do to win them over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YS: Which brings us to the second live album, &lt;em&gt;Exit…Stage Left…&lt;/em&gt; a more sophisticated approach to a live album this time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a5/Rush_Exit_Stage_Left.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AL: Indeed, both in terms of our popularity and the technology of presenting and recording a live performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YS: From smaller Canadian venues to hard rock arena gods…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GL: If I called myself a “hard rock arena god” at home, my children would laugh their heads off…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AL: Ooh, let me choose the song this time: “Spirit of Radio”. Not to duplicate again, but I just love how this one opens the album. I think it’s our best opening song from our entire catalog. And the live performance has a different approach than the album version. More relaxed, almost. Geddy’s vocal sounds like he’s talking to you over a beer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YS: He IS talking to me over a beer. And I totally get your point. It’s somehow less aggressive than the studio version, and that seems like it shouldn’t work, but it does. And I love how the crowd cheers when you sing “Concert Hall!”, just like on the album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AL: OK, here’s where the choices are going to get more interesting…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GL: Or totally uninteresting…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YS: Are you referring to your “Hey, we’ve got lots of keyboards!” period?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GL: Well, it wasn’t too bad yet on &lt;em&gt;Signals&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.cygnus-x1.net/links/rush/images/tourbooks/signals/signals-cover.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YS: Agreed. That was the first Rush album I bought when I was a kid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AL: OK, so you pick the song this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YS: Too easy to say “Subdivisions”, so I’m going to choose “Analog Kid”. The guitar riff, the power of the drum line, the great sound on Geddy’s Rickenbacker. The whole song just fits together perfectly. You can hear the influence of the 80’s and new wave starting to creep in, but it’s still undeniably Rush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GL: I’m finding your answers to these questions a lot more interesting than ours…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AL: Agreed. When &lt;em&gt;Grace Under Pressure&lt;/em&gt; came out, did you still like it as much?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/66/Rush_Grace_Under_Pressure.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YS: Well, you remember this was a time when an album release was a big deal, going to Tower Records and trying to pick it up on the first day. I really liked this album. In retrospect, I hear the keyboards a lot more now than I did at the time. Back then, I just heard a really good Rush album. And I’ve got to pick “Kid Gloves”. One of the most underrated Rush tracks, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AL: I’m always curious when talking to fans from that period when they started to grow less excited about our albums…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YS: I’d say that &lt;em&gt;Power Windows&lt;/em&gt; is still a strong album. But a bit of a slip- for me, as a kid- from what I was used to. Not what I was used to in terms of sound, but how it made me feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e2/Rush_Power_Windows.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GL: “Territories” is the song I’d choose to represent that album. Not necessarily the best song, but I really liked how that one has lasted over the years. The synthesizers aren't overbearing, and it's got some great bass and guitar parts. Still very fun to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YS: Yeah, I've always been partial to that one as well. And that brings us to your last studio album for Mercury, &lt;em&gt;Hold Your Fire&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81EXoV6s1YL._SL1200_.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AL: …which you don’t like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YS: (winces) No, I’m sorry. I really don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GL: We get that a lot. And we totally agree. It’s easily our worst album. I really let my fascination with the keyboard sounds get away from me. And it was covering up Alex’s guitar in the mix. I don’t know to this day why Neil and Alex didn’t leave, or at least give me a swift kick in the rear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YS: So what song would you choose from here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AL: Well, none of them. If someone had never heard us, I certainly wouldn’t want them to start here. But if I had to, I'd pick the opener, "Force Ten". That song had a good grove and chord sequence; I’d love to hear it clean with just drums, guitar and bass, played a bit more dirty and aggressive. And it's the one from that album that fans seem to want to hear still more than any other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/02/Rush_A_Show_of_Hands.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GL: The same is true of the next live album, and the last in this new Mercury release, &lt;em&gt;A Show of Hands&lt;/em&gt;. There are so many songs on there I’d like to play again with a different approach. When I listen to how we did “Turn the Page”, for example, it just makes me cringe. Better than the album track, but so much untapped potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YS: That’d make an interesting album concept- ‘80’s Rush songs the way we wish we’d played them’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AL: (looks at Geddy) I think he’s onto something there…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GL: Yeah, we’ll come back for another interview so you can help us suss out the track list. If you’ll buy us more beer…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YS: Deal! Gentlemen, it really has been a pleasure. Thank you so much for being so gracious with your time, and good luck on the rest of your tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AL: Thank you. We’ll have to talk about the rest of our albums next time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This is the first cache in a series, stay tuned for more caches. The nasty nano series is designed to help the mediocre nano size cache population in Bend. Remember, nano caches are not micro size; these are smaller, way smaller!</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This nano is on the way to Shevlin Park on Shevlin Park Road. There is a lot of cache down in Shevlin so this should be a good on the way cache. 

Bring a pen, this cache does not hold ANYTHING besides the small log roll. It's tiny.

**note: lots of muggles, stealth required**

No hint because of the easy nature of the cache.

Contents were still child friendly though the bone that was supposed to be adorning the rocks it was hidden under wasn’t there. Perhaps I saw it on the way up but I took a different path down so I didn't have a chance to move and replace it. I’d like to do more in this area but only after the car has gotten dirty and dusty again [:D]

No trees were killed to send this message, but a large number of electrons were terribly inconvenienced

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">A fairly easy cache located along Hwy 20 going North towards Sisters</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache is located away from busy Hwy 20. There is no need to go over the barb-wire fence or across the Hwy. Please stay on the East side of the Hwy. This can be a very busy place at times, so please use stealth. The view of the mountains is best obtained in the morning when the sun is rising from the East and shines all over the Three Sisters.

The following information is from the reader board located North of the cache...

This view of the Three Sisters and their neighbors to the North and South are mentioned in some of Oregon's earliest recorded history. Many explorers passed this way in the early 1800's. Peter Skene Ogden, Hudson Bay Company traders and explorers, encountered this view in December 1825. Botanist David Douglas followed in October 1826. John C. Fremont was nearby in December 1843, following ancient Indian trails on his Southern exploration into Nevada and California. 

Lieutenant H.L. Abbot of the Pacific Railroad Surveys wrote of this view in his journal on September 4th, 1855. "This morning after riding a few miles, we emerged from the forest, and traversed an elevated plateau dotted with cedars (junipers) and sage bushes... The air was uncommonly clear and pure... The snow peaks of the Three Sisters appeared quite near."

It is not known who first used the name Three Sisters to describe these peaks. In the early day, they were often referred to as Faith, Hope and Charity. Starting from the North. These names, however, did not prevail.

I hope you enjoy my geo-cache and please put back exactly as you found it. Bring your own writing utensil. Happy Caching!!!</groundspeak:long_description>

We were expecting it to be a little more of a viewpoint type area rather than still deep in the trees. The name does not lie though that is an arch if ever there was one!

&lt;p&gt;Pill bottle hidden to be found on a snowy day, pencil included. Stealth is fairly important as there may be lots of muggles around here on school days. Meant to be easy for the winter months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2nd in the series. The whole point being that for those crazy cachers (myself included) who are trying for a caching streak of multiple days, weeks or months snow can be the bane of our existence. All these caches are placed near roads that should be cleared when there is snow and they will all be winter safe, no looking in rocks or on the ground. Note that this location is close to a school, I have kept them far enough away that no one is going to look like a pedophile but do try and not draw attention to yourself. To everyone else these will just be some easy caches in trees but I hope they help to save someone's streak &lt;img src="http://www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile.gif" border="0" align="middle" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always cache in trash out! Be safe, don't do anything you don't feel comfortable with and good luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6em;"&gt;P.S. I would love feedback on the helpfulness of hints, the accuracy of ratings or anything else that you can think of that would improve the experience for those after you&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Located with a magnificent view of the Deschutes river and small lake, this spot here is one of my favorite places to sit, take it all in, and think for yourself in the busy lives we all lead (It's even better towards dusk!).

You can approach the cache from either the Points West trailhead (Inn At The Seventh Mountain), Meadow Camp, or Lava Island.

The cache is located within a pretty rocky area, so wear good shoes and probably should avoid bringing the kids on this one (They can watch from up above though). Some bushwhacking may be required depending which way you go, but it's better to go to the top of the rocks and climb down. You'll be looking for a small glass container, big enough to hold a pencil and tiny logbook, and possibly a very small item if you can get it in there.

Enjoy!</groundspeak:long_description>

 6. Leave unit on disk for three minutes.  Mark and record

 7. While waiting for GPS walk to the North and bag Benchmark 938.  On your way there look for a fallen "V" tree.  The cache is located near its base.  The cache contains only a log book. Sorry no SWAG.
 8.  Log your find and tell me the coords and the altitude (if so equipped) you get after three minutes and the type of GPS unit.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">When we signed the log book, we were surprised that we couldn't find any entries newer than two years ago - this may be the loneliest cache we have ever found! Our Garmin Oregon 450T measured  N44° 1.210 W121° 22.167, elevation 1185 meters (3887.8 feet) after 11 minutes of averaging, which is how long it took us to find the benchmark, find the cache, and return to the GPS. Cache is still there, but the instructions are a little misleading. When we couldn't find a tree with a cache, we started looking at things smaller than a tree and bigger than a tuft of grass. Eventually we found it. Should also mention that this is more of a 2/2 cache than a 1/1. TFTH.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">It may be a little bit easier than the last one, but it's definitely on the high side of a two for terrain.  Fantastic area!  Speaking of the other one, I didn't realize it was not still available.  It did seem awfully close...which was strange, but it was in my gps from last year so I gave it a look, and found it pretty easily.  It definitely would have made my favorite list for the sit and sign location...pretty bummed that I can't log it though...oh wait, found it!

Thanks,
Skadog

Grabbed this one along the way on our first walk here today. Thanks for helping us take a nice hike today!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">I dropped my two kitties off at the vet (well, their trackable dopplegangers anyway).  Come visit them, pick them up and take them traveling, or drop off your own cats (or whatever trackables).  We're starting this cache off with lots of fun cat-related trinkets, too, both because of the site and because my son and I love kitties.
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This large cache should be easy to find, and great fun for kids.  We've loaded it with lots of fun cat-related trinkets, so please trade when possible, but this is meant to be a first-timer-friendly cache, so if you don't have a trinket with you today, feel free to take a sticker or button, and pay it forward later by dropping a trinket in a later cache even if you don't take one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We are also starting two trackables in this cache, each of which represent one of our pet cats who visit this vet for their checkups.  Please do NOT take the trackables (each of them have an orange tag on them, with a unique code inscribed in it) unless it's to pass them along to another cache within a few days or weeks.  Items with trackable tags/numbers are not meant to be kept, but are meant to be passed along to another cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is outside the business and can be accessed day or night.  You might need to open something, but you don't need a key.  It's okay to park in the clinic parking lot after 6:00 p.m. or on weekends, but please leave the parking lot for clients during the week and park on the street.  At all times, please be respectful of the business and their property.  The owner has given permission for the cache to be placed there, and I don't want to lose that permission.&lt;br /&gt;

Cache was right were it was supposed to be and with a level two difficulty (and in my opinion so should all "outdoor" caches) there is just a piece of it barely visible at the right angle. That is, no need to tear up the landscape looking for it.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Welcome to the Deschutes National Forest Paperback Library. You are looking for a larger-than-normal sized ammo can. The Library is open when the area is free of snow.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache is exactly what it says it is- a cache for trading paperbacks. Here are the library rules:

1. Please no geojunk. Books only. Nothing gross that you wouldn't give to your gramma or niece. If you wanna leave a coin or TB, go ahead.
2. Take a book only if you leave one as well. Each is in a separate ziploc. Don't take the bags; just put the one you're leaving in the same bag as the one you took.
3. Once you take a book, keep it. No need to return anything. 
4. If you take/leave, please say in the log book and in your log below what you took and what you left. I will be using the logs to update the list of available books so people can see what's currently out there.
5. If you could care less about the books and just want your smiley, you are of course welcome. 

Now, I suppose you might want some directions. The best place to park is at Aspen Camp. This area gets a bit congested during rafting season, but that'll all disappear as soon as you hit the trail. I found approaches from below and from above to be equally difficult, so pick your poison. Or try one of each so you can hike a small loop. Reception in the trees could- no, WILL- be iffy, so make the usual changes to your strategy. The north numbers ranged from .071 to .084 while I was there; the west numbers varied less. In addition to the hint below, let me throw you a bone: you're in the ballpark if you find yourself directly downhill from a large, dead deciduous tree. Expect a physically and perhaps mentally challenging search, but you should have enough here to get you zeroed in.

So put down that backpack full of books you brought, roll up your sleeves, and get searching! Those paperbacks aren't gonna read themselves!

From the largest ponderosa.
So drop from above or climb from below,

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;I've been meaning to hide this series for quite some time and today I finally got around to putting out 3 of what I hope to be a 12 part series, maybe even a bonus at the end who knows. The whole point being that for those crazy cachers (myself included) who are trying for a caching streak of multiple days, weeks or months snow can be the bane of our existence. All these caches are placed near roads that should be cleared when there is snow and they will all be winter safe, no looking in rocks or on the ground. Note that this location is close to a school, I have kept them far enough away that no one is going to look like a pedophile but do try and not draw attention to yourself. To everyone else these will just be some easy caches in trees but I hope they help to save someone's streak &lt;img src="http://www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile.gif" border="0" align="middle" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always cache in trash out! Be safe, don't do anything you don't feel comfortable with and good luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6em;"&gt;P.S. I would love feedback on the helpfulness of hints, the accuracy of ratings or anything else that you can think of that would improve the experience for those after you&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">After going after some FTF's on the Lucky Lake trail and not getting lucky we hit the trail from our camp at Little Lava Lake to go after the few caches here that had not been found yet. After quite a hike we got to this one. Unfortunately for us my phone loaded me the wrong information and we thought it was Bent 2... We looked and looked for the "tree by the trail" and couldn't find anything (probably because it was 200m away). I checked the phone again and what do you know this one is lava hole... thanks stupid phone for loading the wrong one... After we stopped looking for the crazy bendy arm tree Hoots found the cache right away. The log revealed we were {*FTF*} so we inked the log and headed on to the next one leaving Bent 2 for later... Thanks for the adventure!</groundspeak:text>

It's even a great place to bring goodies for a nice Bar B Que as the fire grills are provided. If you have a guitar you can sit by a tall Ponderosa Pine tree and sing to nature. There is a wonderful nature walk up river from the cache site if you're feelin' a bit outdoorsy !

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p style="margin:0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;font:10.0px Geneva;"&gt;For the last eight years I’ve been volunteering with the U.S. Geological Survey during the summer as a field assistant to help with the geologic mapping of Newberry Volcano. Over the last few months I’ve been exploring the relationship between the Deschutes River and the western margin of the “basalt of Bend” from Tumalo to Sunriver.  As a final need in that project, I had to explore the area along the western edge of the Lava Butte flow. Since I was going to be out here I decided to drop a series of caches. All caches are in small plastic storage containers (about 8”x4”x4”) and all are located on the Lava Butte flow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing:0.0px;"&gt;This cache is located in a kipuka of the ~78,000 year old “basalt of Bend” surrounded ~7,000 year old Lava Butte flow. The old canyon rim of the Deschutes River prior to the Lava Butte flow forms the western margin of the kipuka. The Lava Butte flow spilled into the old canyon from the north and south to form the kipuka. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;font:10.0px Geneva;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing:0.0px;"&gt;Due to the remote location no attempt was made to hide the cache other than placing it in a sheltered location.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

This was the last stop for a cache I hadn't done on our hike of 9.67 miles over 10 long hours. Made the find after some looking and a nice hide. Actually parked and started our hike from the end of Osage Rd. but after hiking over to #3 we decided to do the last two instead of hiking back the way we came. A real challenge getting back to civilization from this area of the lava flow. Did manage to hike around the lava sufficiently again for this one and the find was made without having to climb on too much lava again. TFTH. TNLNSL</groundspeak:text>

My feet are aching, had to stop at the Deschutes and grab some water, saw lots of elk sign in the pines on the Deschutes side of the flow. I'm done with walking the lava though. The walk back after this one was painful. After 8 miles on my feet I was done.  We made our way out closest we could find and called for a pickup as we sat on the road wondering if we'd ever walk again. TFTC

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">"An equinox occurs twice a year, when the tilt of the Earth's axis
is inclined neither away from nor towards the Sun, the center of
the Sun being in the same plane as the Earth's equator. The term
equinox can also be used in a broader sense, meaning the date when
such a passage happens. The name "equinox" is derived from the
Latin aequus (equal) and nox (night), because around the equinox,
the night and day are approximately equally long. It may be better
understood to mean that latitudes +L and -L north and south of the
Equator experience nights of equal length."

Nice sunny day to be out and about after the rain/snow in the pass the night before.  

Even if the dry-siders aren't thrilled with the puzzles, keep placing 'em.  There are definitely puzzle solvers from the wet side who appreciate it!  Thanks muchly!</groundspeak:text>

The waypoints are in no particular order as they are dependant on where you park. There is limited parking M-F during the day. I strongly suggest doing this after 5 or on a weekend. Thank you lavabear for giving me the idea to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

I almost screwed up the part about the spoons, but then I remembered that I should not try to bend the spoon, but instead I should realize the truth, and it suddenly all started to make sense.  From the top it does kind of look like a concrete jungle with all the meandering paths.  

Thanks for the tour!  The ada ramps on the main drag look very well designed and constructed...just an observation.

&lt;p class="MsoNormal" align="baseline"&gt;Scientific evidence suggests that Earth is rapidly warming and some recent studies indicate that there is a direct relationship to &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5441976" style="color:rgb(204, 0, 0);"&gt;Global Warming&lt;/a&gt; and the gases (particularly CO2) we have emitted into the atmosphere.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; PBS featured a &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/warming/" style="color:rgb(204, 0, 0);"&gt;NOVA/Frontline Report April 24, 2007&lt;/a&gt; that offers an excellent overview to the immediate threats brought on by Global Warming.  The &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/warming/etc/graphs.html" style="color:rgb(204, 0, 0);"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Report offers facts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that can help us thread-the-needle in the efforts to reverse the trend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;img src="http://powergridtech.com//Geocache%20Pix/Global%20Warming/CO2.gif" /&gt; &lt;span style="font-family:georgia,times new roman,times,serif;font-style:italic;color:rgb(51, 51, 153);"&gt;"Over a 40 year period, scientist Charles Keeling measured the amount of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub style="font-family:georgia,times new roman,times,serif;font-style:italic;color:rgb(51, 51, 153);"&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:georgia,times new roman,times,serif;font-style:italic;color:rgb(51, 51, 153);"&gt;) in the atmosphere. The above "Keeling Curve" shows the increase in total concentrations of CO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub style="font-family:georgia,times new roman,times,serif;font-style:italic;color:rgb(51, 51, 153);"&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:georgia,times new roman,times,serif;font-style:italic;color:rgb(51, 51, 153);"&gt;in the atmosphere from 1957-1997. This unbroken record of the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere shows how it's gone up, in round numbers, from around 315 parts per million to around 370 parts per million on average today. This data is widely accepted by everyone. (Nova/Frontline Report)"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;A good downloadable tool, Google Earth, can be used fly around the globe and visit some of the past and current point-sources of pollution. As an alternative, you can go to http://www.wikimapia.org and search against the names listed in the Fly To sites&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; You will be visiting the &lt;a href="http://skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?20374745" style="color:rgb(204, 0, 0);"&gt;tallest smoke stacks&lt;/a&gt; in the world!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt; Magna, UT  Kennecott Copper Smelter Stack,  370.4 meters (#4 world highest stack) &lt;img src="http://powergridtech.com//Geocache%20Pix/Global%20Warming/Kennecott3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;a href="http://earth.google.com/" style="color:rgb(204, 0, 0);"&gt;Google Earth&lt;/a&gt; has a “Fly To” tab.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; You will copy a location from the list below, paste it into the tab field and hit the ENTER key on your computer.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Google Earth will fly you to the vicinity of a stack, where you can pan around to observe some interesting features, in addition to the gigantic stacks.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Remember, these stacks are TALL so as to disperse the toxic gases and CO2 downwind from the worksite, but all of the gases then mix into the atmosphere.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; The smelter stacks you will visit have vented mega tonnage of toxic metal waste into the atmosphere during their operational history, along with carbon oxides.  Some of these facilities, such as Kennecott at Magna UT, have been made to be very efficient and even capture the sulfuric acid gases as a commercial byproduct.  To identify the stack site, float your mouse over the small Google Earth icons you see on the satellite hybrid maps. If you don't have Google Earth freeware installed on your computer, just visit the link http://www.wikimapia.org and use the search engine to locate the target stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt; INCO Nickel Smelter Stack,  381 meters (#2 highest stack in the World) (Brazilian Ownership)&lt;img src="http://powergridtech.com//Geocache%20Pix/Global%20Warming/INCO.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;A good example of this acid fallout is the jet-black granite around Greater Sudbury Ontario, where the sulfuric acid rain has penetrated the pink-gray granite to a depth of 3 inches and permanently dyed the granite jet black. &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The INCO Superstack is the tallest freestanding chimney in the Western hemisphere, with a height of 381 m (1,257 ft).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;At each “Fly To”&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; location, zoom down to where you can see the stack opening and float your mouse to the center of the stack exhaust exit.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Record the minutes for both latitude and longitude of the stack for some later number crunching.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Of course, because we are looking down on the stack from above but at an angle, not straight down the stack hole, the number you record is not the actual location of this stack, but that is not our objective in this exercise.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Any reading 30 or more seconds is rounded to the next minute of reading, ie. N44*16’30” gives 17 for the minutes value and adding the two digits (1+7) gives 8.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; N44*16’29.9” gives 16 minutes or a sum of 7.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Got it, OK!&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">What an adventure this was!  Both of us "Google Earthed" the stacks (what an eye opener that was) then compared notes.  Pretty darn close on coordintes but still needed a nudge from the CO.  First waypoint in hand, we set off on this cool morning to see how far we'd get.  Surprisingly, the waypoints were fairly close together and we found ourselves in somewhat familiar territory.  Found the waypoints fairly quickly but the final was a bit more of a challenge.  After reading every log and searching every crack mid way down the face, we ended up phoning a "friend",  rewalking the top and finding the skinny path to the cache!  Yeah!  Beautiful spot!  Really appreciated the CO's cooperative spirit with this one!</groundspeak:text>

I've been itching to get out there all week, but this morning was especially beautiful, and I'm glad I waited for it.  The final location was breathtaking with the early morning sun glistening on the water.  I thought for a minute that I could be the only person on earth...and then someone went running by.
Thanks for a great cache.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We have been steadily working on our qualifications for both the WA Fizzy and the Original Fizzy Challenge in California.  We finished up the WA Fizzy a few weeks ago, but were still two caches short for the Original Fizzy, which requires all caches to be published prior to April 2007.  There is not a cache with this Diff/Terr combo in Washington that is old enough to qualify.  So...off we went to Bend for this cache.  

Any time you travel this far for a single cache, you feel a certain amount of pressure to find it.  I solved the puzzle at home (it was lots of fun to see all the big stacks) and we really lucked out on WP1 and WP2.  The final however gave us fits!  We tried the low approach first and wished we had checked out the high approach instead.  Eventually, we spotted the right place to squeeze in.  The cache is in great shape and had lots of cool swag.  We stamped the log and left a pathtag for the next finders.

Thanks so much for placing and maintaining this great cache.  We love the care that was taken with each step and the fun journey we experienced.  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

The mosquitoes were awful on the recent visit so we elected to come back today for the find.  Problem was we approached from the shortest distance from the old cinder road and got caught up in all the blow-down timber.  A better approach is to go down this road from south of the cache and head overland at 020 true when 0.3 from the cache.  That route will take you through an open pondo forest with few obstacles to deal with.  Mosquitoes were still an issue today.  

That sure was an old camp area at the final.  There is a thinning operation nearby but the cache is safe.  BaileyBellaBC</groundspeak:text>

Pretty sure I may need another hint on this one or it may become my nemesis cache. Anyone one of you finders out there want to throw me a bone???</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The &lt;a href="http://culinary.cocc.edu/"&gt;Cascade Culinary Institute&lt;/a&gt; has recently completed completed construction of their shiny new facilities near this cache; another opportunity for advanced education in our humble Bend, OR. And do you know what an institute of higher learning brings with it? That's right: COLLEGE FOOTBALL!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, folks, in addition to kickin' out a mean crème brûlée, the students at CCI will also be fielding a football team. And what they need from YOU is a mascot name! When you log this cache, please suggest what you think their football mascot should be. Personally, I'm leaning toward the Galloping Whisks, but let's hear your suggestions. I have included a website above to spur some of your creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, no, reviewers, this is not an ALR, so don't get yer feathers in a ruffle. If cachers want to log it by saying "t4tc", "TNLNSL", or by pasting in their new mystery novel, they are more than welcome to be boring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, I have just one more question for you: &lt;b&gt;Are you ready for some football???&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is a 3-stage cache that I hid, and this one should be a toughie. Each wapoint is around the same size as the final, and they all hold only LEGOs. One cache is for only city legos, one is for only starwars legos, and one is only for knights legos, so bring all kinds of legos! Each waypoint you can trade LEGOs, TBs, and Geocoins. Each container holds the coordinates to the next, until the final. There is an FTF prize in each of the caches only take one per group.

Hope you can find this one!

All afternoon we struggled with inexact coords, but we still managed to find 21 Sea Flyer caches plus 3 others.

This was in an area we'd never been before.  We found the correct road to get close, then found the cache.  We also found the refrigerator and TV someone dumped just down the road.  Yuck.  T4TC.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This is a difficult cache to get to because: 1. it is in the middle of nowhere (kinda) 2. You have to climb the side of a mountain to find the cache.  Not for the weak, frail or non-dedicated cachers.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache is located at the top of Sheridan Mountain in the Deschutes National Forest.  Sheridan Mountain is one of the first mountains south of Mt. Bachelor, one of the finest places to ski in the Northwest.  The top of this mountain is a crater and the cache is located on the top rim of the bowl on the western side in the top of a tree stump.  The cache is connected to the cache defender with a piece of duct tape.

This one of our favorite locations in Central Oregon.  You have a 360 degree view of the surrounding terrain, buttes, mountains and lakes.  We suggest that you take plenty of water, a lunch and your stamina with you on this hunt.  We park our car at this way point N 43 53.965  W 121 40.926 which is at the end of a forest service road.  The elevation at the top of Sheridan Mountain is 6956 feet MSL and the spot that we park at is 6277 feet MSL.  This area is not accessible when snow is on the ground. 

We hope you enjoy this hunt and can't wait to hear about your adventures in finding this cache.  By the way, since getting there is such a challenge, we place the cache defender out in the open.  Have fun and happy caching - Pdxblues!</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Out bright and early this morning to do some caches in the Sheridan Mountain and Kwohl Butte area. Drove up the backside and parked at the above coordinates. Need a high clearance 4X4 rig that can be "pen striped" to get there but makes the hike up shorter (.18 crow), but maybe steeper(quite a gut-buster). Don't have to deal with red cinders though. Total hike was .93 in 1:10 including 20 minutes of looking and a total ascent of 463 ft. The sad news is it appears the defender was a "counter agent" and has kidnapped the cache. Looked high and low around the main stump at GZ as well as within a 50 ft. radius without success. Ended up sighing the "wooden log" on top of the primary stump in the area.  TFTH.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">For whoever comes up here next - I may be mistaken, but I believe that it is no longer possible to park at the recommended parking coordinates for this cache.

We parked at 43 53.747 by 121 41.078, which is about a quarter mile from the suggested parking coords. This seemed to work well.

There is a road closure at the place we parked. The closure is pretty recent, but is also permanent, so I suspect that this the road the cache owner used to reach his suggested parking coords back in 2005. There's a newish sign marking the closure, and there are some trees intentionally laid across the old road. At the owner's parking coords, there are also logs laid in the road like they don't want anyone here any longer. 

We hiked cross country from where we parked to the owner's parking coords, kind of treating them as an intermediate waypoint, and then ascended the mountain from there. That worked pretty well. I suspect that we could have hiked out the closed road and eventually reached the parking coords as well, but the road bended the long way around a hill, so we didn't follow it to find out. On the way back we cut across the short side of the triangle (formed by our car, the owner's parking cords, and the cache) a little bit but you can't go straight that way entirely anyway as there's a deep crater quite near where we parked that you have to go around.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Woo-hoo!  We needed a 3.5/5 cache to finish up the last of our Fizzy Challenge difficulty/terrain combinations.  There were several options that were closer, but this one sounded the most interesting, so we drove the 100+ miles over to the dry side of the state to do it.  No disappointment here - this was a difficult hike as the angle of ascent seemed to be between 30 and 40 degrees most of the way up.  Up at the top, the views were magnificent to the south and east.  We were a little bummed that the trees on the north side of the mountain mostly obscured the view of the Sisters.  That's ok - still a nice ending to a long day of butte and mountain hiking.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">You will find Meadow Bounce near a popular trailhead west of downtown Bend.  Park near the coordinates provided above.  It was originally one of the Bounce contest caches placed during the month of September.  Now this cache is available to everyone!</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Logistics:  Be especially careful on the “washboard“ road as one could end up in the ditch or crashed into an on-coming rig.  Parking spaces are provided near the coordinates; there is no need to park on the road.  A Trailhead Parking Fee is not required (at this time).

Meadow Bounce has been placed about 437 feet at 68 degrees true, from the coordinates (the first Meadow Trailhead bulletin board).  Use your true compass (set at seventeen degrees declination) and your GPS together, to find this cache.

Steve Hayden, USFS trail crew supervisor for the Bend-Ft. Rock Ranger District, and Marv Lang, Recreation Manager, have been working to restore this scenic area for some time, applying modern management ethics to a misused area still called “Meadow Camp” in 1995.  Compacted areas and outlaw user trails have been eliminated.  As you seek this cache, note the most recent and creative restoration work.

The area where Meadow Bounce is cached is a rock climbing and bouldering area, popular due to its proximity to Bend.  Steve and his crew have worked hard to move the main trial away from the riverbank and to give access by several trace trails to the rock cliffs.  PLEASE STAY ON THE DEVELOPED TRAILS AND WAYS IN THIS AREA.

Rock climbing and bouldering are dangerous!  Not long ago, one senior athlete died after he fell about 30 feet from these Meadow cliffs, and later an outdoor parks and recreation leader climbing alone, was hospitalized with broken bones from a fall from these same rocks.  NO ROCK CLIMBING IS NECESSARY TO FIND MEADOW BOUNCE.

Meadow Bounce has lots of trade goods including some from the original Bounce contest.</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Look for a fire-marked stump on a rock when the bearing and distance you have been given are on point.  Meadow Bounce is located about eight lateral feet from a side of the stump, in a logical place and can be seen from some distance if one is looking in the right direction.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Time passes and as we noted in the original description, the coordinates given in the description are those of the "original" USFS sign board in 2002 before Pay to Play charges were imposed.

Note that a "bearing" is a line FROM a point (the old sign location/the coordinates given) TO a second point, the cache.

Note that you are asked to stay on established trails and "WAYS", a typical sly misdirection of the Golden Age of Geocaching, years ago. Have you read all of the comments by successful Finders on your computer, not your smart phone? Has a climbers trace or WAY become overgrow a bit since 2002?

Use your wonderful GPS receiver by projecting the cache location. (Consult your GPS Manual.)

For busy folks who do not read Manuals :-)), You can wander in the direction of 68 degrees TRUE (you surely do have your GPS set to True bearings to match your maps, do you not?? Can you set the direction to TRUE in a smart phone?)

Keep the original coordinates as your GPS GO TO instruction.

When you wander on a "trace" or "way" out 437 feet FROM THE ORIGINAL SIGN, move right or left until you are at the RECIPROCAL of 68 degrees and look for the old burned stump.

We hope this helps!

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Missy dog &amp; I recently finished Volcanoguy's excellent Benham series of multis, which we highly recommend.  During one of our scouting trips for those caches (read: we didn't find it that day) we found a road that beckoned us.  Today, a crisp late autumn day, we walked up that road, about an hour round trip. The hide isn't special, just a way to get some exercise in a beautiful chunk of forest.  There may indeed be a way to access that road from somewhere else, but we wanted a nice walk.  This cache should be accessible via mountain bike, x-c skis, and snowshoes, too.</groundspeak:long_description>

The part that isn't on roads is nice open forest with easy walking. A little more than 2 miles round trip, a little more than 200 ft. gained. 

I did this one pre-Benham, rather than post. Found it very close to Big Eddy's coords. Cache was in good shape after so long with no love. Proudly put down my name and trotted back to my ride. Thank you for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Micro sized cache in Compas Park or as like to call it the Spinny Park cause everything spins. This is an extremely high muggle area so use super stealth (this means if there are people near by just come back later, this cache will make you look sketchy) and I would recommend doing this cache at night actually. BYOP because there is only really room for log inside the cache
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">There are so many caches in small pocket parks and I was startled to find that this location was unclaimed by a geocache so I set out to claim it. The park is framed on all sides by houses so act casual, be discrete and in general try not to draw attention to yourself. The location of the cache is right by the main spinny center and I encourage one and all to try out the toys are they are most fun though can make you dizzy quite easily.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="color:rgb(89, 74, 66);font-family:Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, sans-serif;line-height:18px;"&gt;As always cache in, trash out. Be safe, don't do anything you don't feel comfortable with and good luck.&lt;/span&gt; P.S. I would love feedback on the helpfulness of hints and the accuracy of ratings or anything that you could think of that would improve the experience for those after you&lt;br /&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Who will study our civilization when we are gone, and what will they make of our culture, our religion and our rituals? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The art in the center of our roundabouts will long outlive the roads and is sure to confuse them a little.  And then there are the weird hoists we built to carry us to the top of some mountains, which most certainly must have been part of some sort of a religious ritual.  And what will they think when they stumble across our geocaches?  Will they be mistaken for some sort of offering to keep the demons at bay, or is that actually what they are for some of us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing is for certain…we are leaving a mark and the evidence is everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find this cache you must find the tip of the inner loop and search for the final cache coordinates there.  Yeah, it's that easy.  I will be a good dog though, and throw a couple of bones your way.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I placed no less than four sets of coordinates at the tip of the loop to make it a little easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6em;"&gt;Second, a hint; if you think you are in the right area but can't find the coordinates, it might just be that you are not listening.  Make yourself as still as possible, and with the right conditions, the answer you seek just might come to you on the wind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy the journey, whether you find it or not.  All of the waypoints are within one half mile of the listed coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;

Well, uphill if you are headed South along the river, downhill if you are headed North.  We were headed South so that uphill section was responsible for Kristin's leg cramps cramps!

The cache is a little camo tupperware container with logbook and pencil and a few random goodies as well as a travelbug to get it started.  To get to this cache you will have to hike or bike a fair amount.  You can combine this cache with a few others in the area for a good day of hiking and caching.</groundspeak:long_description>

Because of its nearness to the trail, if you do find it, please conceal it carefully.  If, however, you fail miserably, feel free to ask for help.

This section of trail doesn't see as much use as others in the area, so you should have a reasonable amount of privacy for a good search. If you are biking to this, be aware that parts of this section are very technical.

A little bit of blood the second time. First time I was there, I was walking all over it. I just didn't look in quite the right location. I wasn't going to give up so easy though, came back and got it this time! Grabbing this one as part of the Geocaching Road Trip '15, looking for a cache with 10+ favorite points. Thanks for the adventure! Found a few new biking and walking trails while caching out there.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">While we are enjoying a week at the Lava Lake Resort we had to give this series a look-see.  As have others, we decided to do this one clockwise starting with Lava 14.  After completing the loop around the lake, we are glad we chose that route since the bushwhacking from 5 to 6 could have been a bit discouraging to continue.  All caches were found in good shape and right where the coords took us (except for Lava 15 and we will note further information in that log).  The trek through the marsh grasses was not a problem (even for 1/2zip) but you did have to watch your step here and there as it is clear waterfowl and elk use this area frequently.  It could not have been a better day with temperatures in the mid-70's and the skeeters nowhere to be found.  Very enjoyable and challenging series that we are glad to have behind us.

What a beautiful day to be out Geocaching on lava Lake. We hiked about 5 miles and were able to snag 1 FTF.  

We walked clockwise around the lake and we are glad we did. The first few caches are quite a bushwhack over a lot of fallen trees.  We noticed that GC33KEA in the same area has the terrain at 3 1/2.  We would say that that is a good number :) for 6 through 11.

We had a blast, and again, thank you Sea Flyer for putting these out.

Geocaching the world one cache at a time
May the wind always be at your back and the sun shine warm upon your face.
TFTC!
TFTFun!

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We came to hike up to Matthieu lakes this morning, but decided to do this cache first.  I agree with all the other finders who have commented that the solution coords are about 50' off.  Seems like it would be trivial for the CO to fix this offset by modifying the puzzle formulas slightly.  In the meantime, Lavabears' advice was helpful:  "when you are standing at GZ, turn to 125 degrees true (about SE-East) and walk about 50 feet."  Oh, also -- the cache container was pretty full of water, but thanks to the plastic baggy the logsheet was only slightly damp.  Might want to think about a new container though.</groundspeak:text>

We felt like we made it to the true summit by adding the scramble. No views today- too much fog and already a few inches of snow.  I replaced the soggy log . We loved the little treasures but since we had some from the Tam McArthur Rim Cache , we left them for others to enjoy.  See other hint on my note. Thanks!</groundspeak:text>

Well I drove here might as well try it, (I HATE LAVA) got about 100' and drew first blood on the shins, should I quit? No. finally got out about 1/4 mile and seemed to get a little easier to go in a straight line (kind of). finally made it to GZ didn't have any trouble finding the cache. Took the TB since it had been here awhile. Well now that I am halfway done (I HATE LAVA) sat down in shade to cool off and have something to eat but the mosquitoes were hungrier than I was and so headed back. Was a little easier to get back using trackback on the GPS. Longest 2 miles I ever walked, would love to give it a favorite point but not going to   (I HATE LAVA) it wasn't any fun.

Apparently I say this a lot. I need to put it on a T-Shirt. Glad I was able to get out here in my last couple days before moving to Salem.

As have others, we decided to do this one clockwise starting with Lava 14.  After completing the loop around the lake, we are glad we chose that route since the bushwhacking from 5 to 6 could have been a bit discouraging to continue.  All caches were found in good shape and right where the coords took us (except for Lava 15 and we will note further information in that log).  The trek through the marsh grasses was not a problem (even for 1/2zip) but you did have to watch your step here and there as it is clear waterfowl and elk use this area frequently.  It could not have been a better day with temperatures in the mid-70's and the skeeters nowhere to be found.  Very enjoyable and challenging series that we are glad to have behind us.

What a beautiful day to be out Geocaching on lava Lake. We hiked about 5 miles and were able to snag 1 FTF.  

We walked clockwise around the lake and we are glad we did. The first few caches are quite a bushwhack over a lot of fallen trees.  We noticed that GC33KEA in the same area has the terrain at 3 1/2.  We would say that that is a good number :) for 6 through 11.

We had a blast, and again, thank you Sea Flyer for putting these out.

Geocaching the world one cache at a time
May the wind always be at your back and the sun shine warm upon your face.

This being our first cache we were very excited to find just the right spot near one of our favorite trails. We named the cache Heron's perch because we are the Heron family and there are numerous great blue herons found along this stretch of the river. &lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;We found the perfect spot for the cache between 2 trails that run next to the Deschutes river just west of the town of Bend OR. The trailhead starts at Meadow Camp and goes down river. About an 1/8 of a mile down the trail, the trail splits and we found a spot between the upper and lower trails in a lava rock crevice.  My kids spent much of the time balancing on a large ponderosa long the created a bridge over the lower trail. The cache is a plastic container with a screw-on lid that has been painted green and brown to match the surrounding rock and follage, and so it is not mistaken for garbage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;"&gt;A simplified example illustrates the nature of this puzzle.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; In this example, you are looking for a mystery 3-digit number.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; You are given Roman numerals for &lt;b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal;"&gt;each digit&lt;/b&gt; of the number in &lt;span class="GramE"&gt;order,&lt;/span&gt; however there is no spacing between the digits:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:&amp;quot;Lucida Console&amp;quot;;"&gt;IIIVII&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;"&gt;You must figure out where the spaces go.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; A possible solution would be to put the spaces as follows, which would result in a number of 352:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:&amp;quot;Lucida Console&amp;quot;;"&gt;III V II&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt; (352)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;"&gt;But there are other possible solutions, depending on where you put the spaces:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:&amp;quot;Lucida Console&amp;quot;;"&gt;II IV II&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt; (242)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:&amp;quot;Lucida Console&amp;quot;;"&gt;III VI I&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt; (361)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:&amp;quot;Lucida Console&amp;quot;;"&gt;II I VII&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt; (217)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:&amp;quot;Lucida Console&amp;quot;;"&gt;I II VII&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt; (127)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;"&gt;Now suppose a clue is provided:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“The second digit of the 3-digit number is larger than the sum of the other two digits.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;"&gt;Clearly, only one of the above solutions fits the clue: the mystery number in this example is 361.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;"&gt;To find the cache, you must decipher its coordinates.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Roman numerals for each of the 15 digits of the coordinate set are given below in order, but there are no spaces between the digits or the two coordinates.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; You must separate the digits.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; The North coordinate is listed first, followed by the West coordinate:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:20.0pt;font-family:&amp;quot;Lucida Console&amp;quot;;"&gt;IVIIIVVIIVIIIVIIIIIIIIIVVIVIIIVI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;"&gt;Here are some clues:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
1.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; The cache is located within a one-mile radius of the listed coordinates at the top of the page.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
2.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; There are no zeroes in the coordinates.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
3.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; The sum of every other digit, starting with the 2nd, is 32.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; In other words, the sum of the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, and 14th digits is 32.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;"&gt;This shouldn’t be as hard as it may look.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; With a little thought and logic, you can eliminate many of the possibilities quickly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;"&gt;There should be only one solution that fits all of the clues above.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; But just in case there is a duplicate solution, you can verify your coordinates with &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;GeoChecker&lt;/span&gt; before heading out to the cache.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; (Please email me if you do find a duplicate!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

From: U.S. Forest Service Website, Deschutes National Forest, 2002 
The Three Sisters appear as the "Three Sisters" on Preston's map of Oregon of 1856. The name was probably originally applied by members of the Methodist Mission in Salem in the early 1840's, and the individual peaks were given the names "Mount Faith", "Mount Hope", and "Mount Charity", beginning from the north.

Most likely, the missionaries had I Corinthains 13:13 in mind:  "And now these three remain:  faith, hope, and charity (love).  But the greatest of these is love."</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This turned out to be our favorite cache of the day, although we weren't sure we were going to find the cache given 2 previous DNFs.  We spent much time searching where the posted coords led us, to no avail.  Hoping there would be cell service, Mrs. Tbird tried the iPhone app for more logs and (hopefully) photos.  The 2 photos weren't especially helpful -- the prominent tree in one picture is no longer standing.  But, the logs revealed that the coords had been changed more than a few times.  

We used Kestrel Ridge's coords, since 2 people found the cache after KR posted.  Mrs. Tbird was searching one crevice when she looked at the GPS in her hand; it read 1-foot!  A slight adjustment in the search yielded the container!  Hooray!

Since there are no hints given, see our photo to understand what you are looking for.  Remember, there is no need to climb.  And use Kestrel Ridge's coords.  T4TC.</groundspeak:text>

Grabbed this one along the way on our first walk here today. Got another {*FTF*} and kept on hiking up the hill. Thanks for helping us take a nice hike today!</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">While we are enjoying a week at the Lava Lake Resort we had to give this series a look-see.  As have others, we decided to do this one clockwise starting with Lava 14.  After completing the loop around the lake, we are glad we chose that route since the bushwhacking from 5 to 6 could have been a bit discouraging to continue.  All caches were found in good shape and right where the coords took us (except for Lava 15 and we will note further information in that log).  The trek through the marsh grasses was not a problem (even for 1/2zip) but you did have to watch your step here and there as it is clear waterfowl and elk use this area frequently.  It could not have been a better day with temperatures in the mid-70's and the skeeters nowhere to be found.  Very enjoyable and challenging series that we are glad to have behind us.

What a beautiful day to be out Geocaching on lava Lake. We hiked about 5 miles and were able to snag 1 FTF.  

We walked clockwise around the lake and we are glad we did. The first few caches are quite a bushwhack over a lot of fallen trees.  We noticed that GC33KEA in the same area has the terrain at 3 1/2.  We would say that that is a good number :) for 6 through 11.

We had a blast, and again, thank you Sea Flyer for putting these out.

Geocaching the world one cache at a time

No trees were killed to send this message, but a large number of electrons were terribly inconvenienced.

Oh freddled gruntbuggly,
Thy micturitions are to me,
As plurdled gabbleblotchits,
On a lurgid bee,
That mordiously hath blurted out,
Its earted jurtles,
Into a rancid festering confectious organ squealer. [drowned out by moaning and screaming]
Now the jurpling slayjid agrocrustles,
Are slurping hagrilly up the axlegrurts,
And living glupules frart and slipulate,
Like jowling meated liverslime,
Groop, I implore thee, my foonting turling dromes,
And hooptiously drangle me,
With crinkly bindlewurdles,
Or else I shall rend thee in the gobberwarts with my blurglecruncheon,
See if I don't.

First childhood, no limits, no renunciations, 
no goals. Such unthinking joy.
Then abrupt terror, schoolrooms, boundaries, captivity, 
and a plunge into temptation and deep loss.
Defiance. The one crushed will be the crusher now, 
and he avenges his defeats on others.
Loved, feared, he rescues, wrestles, wins, 
and overpowers others, slowly, act by act.
And then all alone in space, in lightness, in cold.
But deep in the shape he has made to stand erect
he takes a breath, as if reaching for the First, Primitive . . .
Then God explodes from his hiding place.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache gets it's name from how I found the location.  Me and a buddy were snowmobiling in the area when we narrowly missed falling into a hole in the snow that was about 12' across and almost as deep.  We decided that it was big enough to park a Volkswagon in  ... hence, Volkswagon Hole.  It's a lava tube vent and should be accessible in both summer and winter as the airflow doesn't allow snow to fill in the hole for long periods of time in the winter.  It's a short hike from the main trail which is both an ATV trail in summer and a snowmobile trail in winter. If you're riding ATV's please ride by the rules and keep those machines on the designated trails ... it's just a short walk from the nearest designated ATV trail. If you come by car be sure it's a high clearance rig ... you can park within 1/2 mile. You're looking for a regular sized ammo can with lots of cool swag ... includes a nice Geocaching sticker for your bumper for the first finder.</groundspeak:long_description>

As have others, we decided to do this one clockwise starting with Lava 14.  After completing the loop around the lake, we are glad we chose that route since the bushwhacking from 5 to 6 could have been a bit discouraging to continue.  All caches were found in good shape and right where the coords took us (except for Lava 15 and we will note further information in that log).  The trek through the marsh grasses was not a problem (even for 1/2zip) but you did have to watch your step here and there as it is clear waterfowl and elk use this area frequently.  It could not have been a better day with temperatures in the mid-70's and the skeeters nowhere to be found.  Very enjoyable and challenging series that we are glad to have behind us.

When we hit Hell Rd. we were pretty thankful as it was easier walking than in the woods!!(FYI we have seen worse roads Elk hunting[:)]) The cache was easily found and with an empty log we were {*FTF*}. This too is not an easy walk/hike from the trail. Although walking down the 700 rd makes the walk a little easier. (It took us 10 minutes to walk from Crazy to Hell rd in the woods.) Thanks for the adventure and glad we were able to pick up a couple ftf that Hoots and Stripes missed tftc.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Love caching with your kids, but getting a little tired of
traditionals? Here's an easy one to introduce them to the wonderful
world of puzzles! You won't find this cache at the posted
coordinates. You are going to use your age to generate two
one-digit numbers that will help you find the coordinates for the
hiding place. Please don't bother lying about your age. Time and
the numbers know the truth...</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;To get the first number...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;take your current age in years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;double the result&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;subtract 4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;divide the result by 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;subtract your age&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gives you a one-digit number we shall call "a".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the second number...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;again, take you current age in years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;double it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add 9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add your age&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;divide by 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add 4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;subtract your age&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gives you a one-digit number we shall call "b".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The north coordinates are N 44°
0(a+1).(a-3)(a-1)(a-3)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The west coordinates are W 121° 1(b+2).(b-1)(b+2)b&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
(the parentheses do not indicate multiplication; they're merely
separating the individual digits in the coordinates)
&lt;p&gt;You can check your answers for this puzzle on &lt;a href=
"http://www.geochecker.com/index.php?code=a58edd66535a56d99a853f613ffe90e4&amp;amp;action=check&amp;amp;wp=47433244505436&amp;amp;name=50757420416e6f746865722043616e646c65206f6e207468652043616b65"&gt;

I put the kayak in at the top of Dillon falls and paddled upstream caching along the way to Benham Falls and then made the return trip. 4.5 miles and 2.5 hours in all. The light rain came down for part of the morning but otherwise the cool summer morning lacked any wind which made for great paddling. In all I was able to find six of the nine caches along this area most of which had not been found in over 18 months. TFTH!</groundspeak:text>

Not finding any evidence of a cache or a wire, we expanded or search away from the river and the burn and made the find.  It's always fun to make those tough finds.</groundspeak:text>

Nice little workout, plus today we had the opportunity to pick up all nine Bad Dogs River Run Caches. But what a day to pick, the river was as high as I have ever seen it, however, it was a very nice day on the water with Jean, sun, wind, caches and lunch on the water at the Duck Blind.

They told us about them and as we were camping nearby soon we decided to look for our own {*FTF*}. We walked the trail until the numbers started getting bigger, then went into the woods. I should have counted the number of downed trees we had to step/climb over.(easily over 100!) We finally made it to the GZ and found it quickly. Lucky for us, it had an empty log. There isn't an EASY way to get here from there. Except to teleport[;)]. Thanks for the adventure. tftc</groundspeak:text>

By the way, how well do you know other central oregon geocachers?</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I just returned from a trip going through Idaho and Washington and got to see some very unique caches, so I decided to make my own unique cache. In order to solve this puzzle, you will need to figure things out about other geocachers that live in central oregon.

N 44' AB.CDE
W 121 FG.HIJ

A = Find the type of cache (Traditional, Multi, Puzzle, etc.) that is Elkjim's 5100th milestone and turn it into a number for each letter in the word. Subtract 5 from that number.

B = How many words long is the first cache that Trek-E's found?

C = Subtract 14 from the day MTN RNR started geocaching.

D = Find the cache name for Bubblegummer's 20th FTF and solve the short math problem in the name. Subtract 23 from the solution.

E = Add two to the month that Trackz Man started geocaching.

F = Find out the town where Lavabears live and turn the town into a number for each letter in the word. Subtract 2 from the solution.

G = How many F's are in the cache name from Kestral Ridge's 400th milestone. Subtract 1 from that number.

H = Turn Putter &amp; Sassy's occupation into a number for each letter in the word. Subtract 3 from that number.

I = What kind of stuffed animal helped give The Fuzzz his geocaching name? Turn that into a number by each letter and subtract 3.

J = How many years was Lost-A-Pair involved in trapshooting? Subtract 16 from that number.


-The hike from the parking area is a little bit over 1/2 a mile round trip.

-You are looking for an ammo box. Please rehide well so the next cacher can find it just as you did. Have fun with the puzzle and happy caching!

Congrats to Lost-A-Pair for FTF!

We almost skipped by this one today, as we had a different adventure on our plates - but being that it was so darned close - we made a swing over to it.   Imagine our surprise, when the 'road' that is clearly marked on the gps - seems to be a driveway.   We thought this was going to be a drive by - not so much.   But, we did find a handy parking place - and had a wonderful little hike through the trees, on a lovely morning.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">First find of the paddle, no better way to start the day. I put the kayak in at the top of Dillon falls and paddled upstream caching along the way to Benham Falls and then made the return trip. 4.5 miles and 2.5 hours in all. The light rain came down for part of the morning but otherwise the cool summer morning lacked any wind which made for great paddling. In all I was able to find six of the nine caches along this area most of which had not been found in over 18 months. TFTH!</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Out this afternoon on the RIVER to enjoy the fall colors with Sam the Cat.  Put-in at Dillon Falls boat launch and quickly made our crossing in the strong current to the east bank, least we succumb to the FALLS.  The water level was down some 4 feet with the Benham rate meter at 660 cfs.  

Loved this autumn adventure and even saw a river otter, evidence of at least hundreds/thousands of beaver on the east bank.  Beavers like solitude and the east bank is backed by HUGE lava fields.  Think again if you want to do this series via land from the RR tracks to the east rather than by water craft.  We completed the RT of 4.75 miles in 3.5 hrs from the 1 pm put-in.  Thanks for the fun today!!  Bailey and BC</groundspeak:text>

Nice little workout, plus today we had the opportunity to pick up all nine Bad Dogs River Run Caches.  But what a day to pick, the river was as high as I have ever seen it, however, it was a very nice day on the water with Jean, sun, wind, caches and lunch on the water at the Duck Blind. Thanks so much for all the great fun TFTF!</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">While we are enjoying a week at the Lava Lake Resort we had to give this series a look-see.  As have others, we decided to do this one clockwise starting with Lava 14.  After completing the loop around the lake, we are glad we chose that route since the bushwhacking from 5 to 6 could have been a bit discouraging to continue.  All caches were found in good shape and right where the coords took us (except for Lava 15 and we will note further information in that log).  The trek through the marsh grasses was not a problem (even for 1/2zip) but you did have to watch your step here and there as it is clear waterfowl and elk use this area frequently.  It could not have been a better day with temperatures in the mid-70's and the skeeters nowhere to be found.  Very enjoyable and challenging series that we are glad to have behind us.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">While we are enjoying a week at the Lava Lake Resort we had to give this series a look-see.  As have others, we decided to do this one clockwise starting with Lava 14.  After completing the loop around the lake, we are glad we chose that route since the bushwhacking from 5 to 6 could have been a bit discouraging to continue.  All caches were found in good shape and right where the coords took us (except for Lava 15 and we will note further information in that log).  This cache was laying out on the ground uncovered so we certainly placed better than found.  The trek through the marsh grasses was not a problem (even for 1/2zip) but you did have to watch your step here and there as it is clear waterfowl and elk use this area frequently.  It could not have been a better day with temperatures in the mid-70's and the skeeters nowhere to be found.  Very enjoyable and challenging series that we are glad to have behind us.

All involve varying amounts of travel across rough lava depending on the route taken, choose your route carefully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p style="margin:0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;font:10.0px Geneva;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing:0.0px;"&gt;For the last eight years I’ve been volunteering with the U.S. Geological Survey during the summer as a field assistant to help with the geologic mapping of Newberry Volcano. Over the last few months I’ve been exploring the relationship between the Deschutes River and the western margin of the “basalt of Bend” from Tumalo to Sunriver.  As a final need in that project, I had to explore the area along the western edge of the Lava Butte flow. Since I was going to be out here I decided to drop a series of caches. All caches are in small plastic storage containers (about 8”x4”x4”) and all are located on the Lava Butte flow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;font:10.0px Geneva;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing:0.0px;"&gt;This cache is located along the contact of the ~78,000 year old “basalt of Bend” and the ~7,000 year old Lava Butte flow. This large area of “basalt of Bend” is bounded on the west by the Deschutes River and on the east by the Lava Butte flow. The Shevlin-Hixon logging camp was located near Lava Island from 1916 to 1921 and sometime during that time period this area was logged.  How did the logs get across the river to the Shevlin-Hixon railroad?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;font:10.0px Geneva;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing:0.0px;"&gt;Due to the remote location no attempt was made to hide the cache other than placing it in a sheltered location.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

This was the fourth stop for a cache I hadn't done on our hike of 9.67 miles over 10 long hours. Made the find after some looking and a nice hide. Actually parked and started our hike from the end of Osage Rd. but after hiking over to #3 we decided to do these last two instead of hiking back the way we came. A real challenge getting back to civilization from this area of the lava flow. Did manage to hike around the lava sufficiently for this one that the find was made without having to climb in the lava again. TFTH. TNLNSL</groundspeak:text>

This micro cache is not located at the above coordinates. Although
you &lt;b&gt;will&lt;/b&gt; need them. Solve the puzzle below to find the
correct coordinates. Start with the coordinates above and apply the
arrows to each digit. You will notice there are either ten digits
(if you ignore "44" and "121") or 15 digits (if you include "44"
and "121") in the dummy coordinates. And the arrow grid is
10-by-15. So you can go across the top or down the side. Choose
wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache name/title is a big hint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica; font-size: 11pt"&gt;
Occasionally, there may be people around, but you should be safe
from view most of the time. Be sure to bring a pen or pencil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica; font-size: 11pt"&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">A quick multi-to get you going in the correct direction. The cache is not at this location. You must first solve a quick puzzle to access the coordinates. Use the three capitilized letters on the sign in front of you above the words "Old Canal Trail". Create the alpha letters into numeric by the number each alpha falls into the alphabet-ie A=1 and Z=26
Coordinates for cache are at N 44 12.ABC  W 121 23.EFG

A= First alpha + third alpha then get rid of the first digit
B= First alpha
C= first digit of second alpha

E= second digit of second alpha
F= third alpha
G= two digits of second alpha added together

Write down the six alpha word on the outside of the container for the final puzzle cache

Over the last few months I’ve been exploring the relationship between the Deschutes River and the western margin of the “basalt of Bend” from Tumalo to Sunriver.  As a final need in that project, I had to explore the area along the western edge of the Lava Butte flow. Since I was going to be out here I decided to drop a series of caches. All caches are in small plastic storage containers (about 8”x4”x4”) and all are located on the Lava Butte flow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;font:10.0px Geneva;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing:0.0px;"&gt;This cache is located near a great view of Dillon Falls from the east side of the river. Here a lobe of the Lava Butte spilled into the old Deschutes River canyon and upstream filled the canyon all the way to the footbridge above Benham Falls. The river now flows along the western margin of the Lava Butte flow and spills back into the old canyon here at Dillon Falls.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;font:10.0px Geneva;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing:0.0px;"&gt;Even though this location is difficult to reach their is evidence that the location is visited so this cache has a couple of rocks hiding it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Actually parked and started our hike from the end of Osage Rd. but after hiking over to this one decided to do the other two instead of hiking back the way we came.

We really enjoyed our time on the trails here. I had seen a bunch of unfound caches around the area and we were hoping to snag a bunch of FTFs and we were not disappointed. We grabbed this one on the way back because we didn't feel like doing the trail blazing on the way. We found an area with "less" down logs and headed off into the bush. After many up and overs we got to GZ and made the find for the {*FTF*}. Thanks for helping us take a nice hike today!</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">While we are enjoying a week at the Lava Lake Resort we had to give this series a look-see.  As have others, we decided to do this one clockwise starting with Lava 14.  After completing the loop around the lake, we are glad we chose that route since the bushwhacking from 5 to 6 could have been a bit discouraging to continue.  All caches were found in good shape and right where the coords took us (except for Lava 15 and we will note further information in that log).  The trek through the marsh grasses was not a problem (even for 1/2zip) but you did have to watch your step here and there as it is clear waterfowl and elk use this area frequently.  It could not have been a better day with temperatures in the mid-70's and the skeeters nowhere to be found.  Very enjoyable and challenging series that we are glad to have behind us.

What a beautiful day to be out Geocaching on lava Lake. We hiked about 5 miles and were able to snag 1 FTF.  

We walked clockwise around the lake and we are glad we did. The first few caches are quite a bushwhack over a lot of fallen trees.  We noticed that GC33KEA in the same area has the terrain at 3 1/2.  We would say that that is a good number :) for 6 through 11.

We had a blast, and again, thank you Sea Flyer for putting these out.

Geocaching the world one cache at a time
May the wind always be at your back and the sun shine warm upon your face.
TFTC!

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I decided I wanted to get out and do something a little more challenging today.  I had wanted to do these for some time and there was no better day than today.  I hiked all the way to Private Bridge and did the caches along the river on the way back.  The only one I did on the way was the multi cache because I would have to backtrack to get it done.  I scrambled across the boulder field on the way and soon found the little red flags.  The little red flag trail was pretty good.  I definitely got off trail a few times but seeing the flags always got me back on trail.  I highly recommend using the red flag trail.  I think they might hae plans to extend the trail as there has been some substantial clearing past the last cache.  Anyway, the red flag trail was easier to use on the way back.  It goes a lot higher on the boulder field and its a little less of a scramble.  It was a beautiful hike.  The scenery was amazing.  I was on trail by 10:00 and there was hardly anyone else around.  The weather climbed into the sixties and there was not a cloud to be seen.  Thanks to all that put these caches out.  I appreciate the Smilies!!

I put the kayak in at the top of Dillon falls and paddled upstream caching along the way to Benham Falls and then made the return trip. 4.5 miles and 2.5 hours in all. The light rain came down for part of the morning but otherwise the cool summer morning lacked any wind which made for great paddling. In all I was able to find six of the nine caches along this area most of which had not been found in over 18 months. TFTH!</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">The highway Elk Jim mentions is closed, due to the 4-5 ft waterlevel drop.  Sam the Cat and KR beached the Dagger at the muddy outlet and considered dragging the trusty red Dagger over the mud flats to some possible floatation on fall waters....but NO...!!...there would be no float on this approach to the Duck Blind during the low fall waters.  

We elected to hoof in the 4 inch mud alongside the outlet stream, following tracks of raccoon, beaver, heron, skunks, and others.  Eventually reached the structure and claimed the find.  This mud is lurking for those who tread upon her surface.  

Voted the series as a favorite but still are looking for River Run 1, since the series starts at RR#2.  Made our way back downstream to Dillon take-out in 40 minutes and exited in the Rooster at 4:30 pm, as the air was becoming humid with the drop in temperatures.  Bailey and BC</groundspeak:text>

Nice little workout, plus today we had the opportunity to pick up all nine Bad Dogs River Run Caches.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I decided I wanted to get out and do something a little more challenging today.  I had wanted to do these for some time and there was no better day than today.  I hiked all the way to Private Bridge and did the caches along the river on the way back.  The only one I did on the way was the multi cache because I would have to backtrack to get it done.  I scrambled across the boulder field on the way and soon found the little red flags.  The little red flag trail was pretty good.  I definitely got off trail a few times but seeing the flags always got me back on trail.  I highly recommend using the red flag trail.  I think they might have plans to extend the trail as there has been some substantial clearing past the last cache.  Anyway, the red flag trail was easier to use on the way back.  It goes a lot higher on the boulder field and its a little less of a scramble.  It was a beautiful hike.  The scenery was amazing.  I was on trail by 10:00 and there was hardly anyone else around.  The weather climbed into the sixties and there was not a cloud to be seen.  Thanks to all that put these caches out.  I appreciate the Smilies!!

Just felt like taking a walk after work today. Please only take an item if you need it. I did.

If you find this cache, I think you are going to be in a very small club of "above average human beings that like to find things".</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well, the Mrs. had other plans for the day so I thought I would punish myself and do the four caches out in the lava fields that we hadn't gotten to. They were LavaFlowAGoGo http://coord.info/GC2ANK8, Hawaiian Oasis Hideout http://coord.info/GC2TPG4, Putter's Happy Place http://coord.info/GC3EKNJ and Sydney's Super Bowl Stash 2011 http://coord.info/GC2NERZ. Ended up hiking about 9 miles in 7.75 hours with total ascent on the two hikes of about 1050 ft. I figure about half of the miles were over lava which made for a long day. 

This was my first trip into the lava this morning and used the parking area near the end of Ochoco Circle. Had a couple of spots both going and coming where I had to change routes as the fissures were just too wide where I was ending up. Wish I would have had a cache container with me as I found another wonderful spot for a cache while roaming the lava. Great location but nasty to get to. TFTH.

After finding the cache and a short rest we headed back to the rig.  Found a much better route and made it back in good shape.  See all the posts from past finders, they are all accurate and apply.  
Glad I had someone to go with me and share the adventure.  Not sure if I want to go get the two others out in the lava now.
I think I thank you for the hike in a massive rockpile.  Now quit picking on me!!!</groundspeak:text>

It has a great affect on your mental well being as well as physical benefits - kind of like geocaching. Keep in mind when you're beginning a fitness program not to become green with envy as you see the others around you who've been at it a while. Just keep thinking thin and you'll be on your way.

Coords are a little jumpy here so use your geo-senses.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is placed with the assistance of our grandkids, who live a short walk to this location. They chose the location during our first visit to their new home.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Our granddaughter loves going on searches "for prizes" with us. She was with me at the fourth cache that I found when she was able to walk two blocks into the woods. She learned how to use the Garmin to get to the right spot. She and her younger brother are not yet skilled to find urban caches, but she alone will find many. They are thrilled to hide this secret prize that most people will not know about. Every time she comes by this trail she will enjoy knowing its a secret! We will enjoy sharing stories from finders of their hide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please park at the designated parking waypoint, no closer to the trailhead or houses, to avoid disturbing the adjoining Muggles. The marked trailhead shows the public access trail without going into any private property. The trail itself becomes a slight uphill to the general location, then off the trail without disturbing any vegetation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please write a private note if there are any issues with the cache. My son lives very close to respond to any maintenance requirements, until the kids can do it by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some stealth is required, because if you retrieve or return this cache while Muggles are watching, the cache won't last long. It should be easy to wait for Muggles to pass before looking for the cache.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Typical NW hide.  Where would you hide a regular size container here?  Not in the rocks, because a kid cache should be safe for them to search.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I decided I wanted to get out and do something a little more challenging today.  I had wanted to do these for some time and there was no better day than today.  I hiked all the way to Private Bridge and did the caches along the river on the way back.  The only one I did on the way was the multi cache because I would have to backtrack to get it done.  I scrambled across the boulder field on the way and soon found the little red flags.  The little red flag trail was pretty good.  I definitely got off trail a few times but seeing the flags always got me back on trail.  I highly recommend using the red flag trail.  I think they might hae plans to extend the trail as there has been some substantial clearing past the last cache.  Anyway, the red flag trail was easier to use on the way back.  It goes a lot higher on the boulder field and its a little less of a scramble.  It was a beautiful hike.  The scenery was amazing.  I was on trail by 10:00 and there was hardly anyone else around.  The weather climbed into the sixties and there was not a cloud to be seen.  Thanks to all that put these caches out.  I appreciate the Smilies!!

Our goal was to find all his caches south of Hwy 242 by riding our bicycles to the cache sites.  All afternoon we struggled with inexact coords, but we still managed to find 21 Sea Flyer caches plus 3 others.

After lunch near the 5-way intersection of the NF-1510 road, we biked northward up the horse trail to this cache.  It was soft and bumpy, probably easier to walk on than ride on.  Found it.  Thanks!</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I decided I wanted to get out and do something a little more challenging today.  I had wanted to do these for some time and there was no better day than today.  I hiked all the way to Private Bridge and did the caches along the river on the way back.  The only one I did on the way was the multi cache because I would have to backtrack to get it done.  I scrambled across the boulder field on the way and soon found the little red flags.  The little red flag trail was pretty good.  I definitely got off trail a few times but seeing the flags always got me back on trail.  I highly recommend using the red flag trail.  I think they might have plans to extend the trail as there has been some substantial clearing past the last cache.  Anyway, the red flag trail was easier to use on the way back.  It goes a lot higher on the boulder field and its a little less of a scramble.  It was a beautiful hike.  The scenery was amazing.  I was on trail by 10:00 and there was hardly anyone else around.  The weather climbed into the sixties and there was not a cloud to be seen.  Thanks to all that put these caches out.  I appreciate the Smilies!!

Final approach is very loose soil with loose rocks. Watch for any of your hiking buddies below you.
Watched the air tankers fly overhead as they fought the Two Bulls wildfire that started 7 miles west of here today.

Took a much higher route back that the park seems to have marked with red flags.... possibly the new river trail path that will tie it into the rest of the Deschutes River trail? Currently, the flagged path is just a little deer trail, but you can avoid the rock slide.

Found with Patchel.

As have others, we decided to do this one clockwise starting with Lava 14.  After completing the loop around the lake, we are glad we chose that route since the bushwhacking from 5 to 6 could have been a bit discouraging to continue.  All caches were found in good shape and right where the coords took us (except for Lava 15 and we will note further information in that log).  The trek through the marsh grasses was not a problem (even for 1/2zip) but you did have to watch your step here and there as it is clear waterfowl and elk use this area frequently.  It could not have been a better day with temperatures in the mid-70's and the skeeters nowhere to be found.  Very enjoyable and challenging series that we are glad to have behind us.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I love puzzles so much that I enjoy trying to qualify for challenges using only puzzle/mystery caches.  So several years ago I decided to try to do the Fizzy challenge using only mystery caches.  Silly me.  [:)]

There are few puzzle options within several hundred miles of my Hillsboro home with this D/T combination, so I decided to go for this one.  The puzzle gave me more trouble than I expected, but the CO graciously gave me a hint that got me to the solution.  (Thank you!)  Now I just had to go out and get the cache.  Despite what you may think from my caching name, I'm a past-middle-aged mom with thrice repaired knees, and I was intimidated by the description of the terrain given by previous finders.  

But we had a long weekend of glorious weather and no other plans, so I decided - what the heck - let's at least give it a try.  

My husband and I headed out the Edison trail, as advised by a few previous finders, until we got as close as we were going to get by trail.  Then we headed off into the brush.  Oh my - what a mess!  You definitely earn your stars on this one.  It might have been only .26 of a mile from the trail to the cache, but we went much further than that, zig-zagging around trees that we couldn't cross over.  After a long time doing this, I saw we were only halfway from the trail to the cache, and I was doubting the wisdom of attempting this.  If one of us wrenched a knee in this brush we'd be in a heck of a mess, and no cache would be worth that.  

But my husband plowed on and I followed until, O' the Joy!  We reached the cache site!  Oh Happy Happy Joy J... wait ... I gotta' go down THERE?!!  [:O]  My husband was having none of it.  He's not fond of heights, and his knee was bothering him from the scrabble up, and he kept pointing off to other spots and saying, "Maybe it's over THERE!"  Well, yeah, but the GPS says it's over HERE.   Plus THIS looked like the photos others posted.  (THANK YOU!)  

Well, I wasn't going to get this close and give up without a try.  I'd done a bit of rock climbing in my youth, so I carefully clambered down and, OH HAPPY DAY - there's the item mentioned in the hint!  And the cache too, neatly tucked into its cozy hiding spot.  I was worried that I wouldn't be able to find it after all that, but it wasn't a problem with the good coordinates, excellent hint, and photos.  (Again, a HUGE THANK YOU!)  The cache is in excellent shape, and I took a stamp and left a church key and SI Lucky Crane (which I thought was appropriate as I thought I was very lucky to have found the cache).  

I wasn't in a hurry to leave - it was nice and cool under there - but we had a long way yet to go.  I was mindful of the adage about climbing Mt. Everest - getting to the top is only half of it; you still have to get home alive.  For the trip back we didn't follow the GPS so much but rather tried to pick areas of lesser obstructions.  We walked much further than the route in, and ended up on the shore of Lava Lake west of the cache.  We were quite exhausted by the time we reached the car, but the realization of our success soon revived us.  (Well, that, and our picnic lunch.)   [:D]

Thanks for the fun puzzle and tough challenge.  It's a beautiful spot, and we wondered all the way how you even found it.  [:D][:D][:D]</groundspeak:text>

Spent today caching around Lava Lake and south and east of Cascade Lakes highway. Have had this puzzle solved since 11/17/07 and finally got around to getting down to this area to make the find. The funny thing was I had input the coordinate incorrectly in our GPS's, which did get us to the right area, but not the right location for the cache. Luckily had the the info available to recheck and found the error. Made the find after climbing over a lot of downfall from the trail and a little bouldering at the cache site. Made it a favorite for the location, not the hike over the blowdown. TFTH. Traded swag L"[b][pink]DUBBLE BUBBLE[/b][/pink]"SL</groundspeak:text>

All of you cachers who spend time outdoors, please take some of the waterproof firestarter to include in your 10 essentials kit! Take several (It's my personal public service activity, and the packets - courtesy of Boy Scout Troop 18 in Bend - make great, useful gifts!)

You can invent your own micro cache or take one already known to mankind (you don't need to have a log inside) and place it in this cache. I would encourage all to try to make a micro of their own and place it in this cache for others to enjoy. You should probably write your group name on the cache so the finder that takes it will know who made the micro cache. It would be cool to find your micro hidden by someone else right?

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is a multipoint cache with 3 intermediate points before the cache is reached. The starting coordinates are for parking spot along the the West Benham Falls road. &lt;/p&gt;
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The four Benham Caches (Fort Benham, Benham View, Benham Falls, and Benham Bonus) are located on the Benham Buttes which are a group of 1.8 million year old rhyodacite domes.  Access to the area is from the road to West Benham Falls trailhead.  There are some roads into the area but the area is posted as no motorized vehicles so please respect the closure.  Many of the roads overgrown but still make great hiking or biking trails.  The first three caches can be done individually or all at the same time as part of a 5 mile loop.  To do the Benham Bonus cache you must do the other three first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The motivation for this cache was to find the location of Fort Benham, which 
  I first visited as a kid in 1956. This fort was built for the filming of the 
  1955 movie “&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048204/"&gt;The Indian Fighter&lt;/a&gt;” 
  starting Kirk Douglas. The fort was built under a Special Use Permit from the 
  Deschutes National Forest to the Bend Chamber of Commerce. In 1957 some scenes 
  of “&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052034/"&gt;Oregon Passage&lt;/a&gt;” were 
  filmed at the fort. In 1958 the movie “&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052300/"&gt;Tonka&lt;/a&gt;” 
  (later renamed “Comanche”) also used the fort. In 1960 and 1961 the fort was 
  used in a number of episodes of the TV series “&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050025/"&gt;Have 
  Gun Will Travel&lt;/a&gt;”. In 1962 a forest fire burned part of the area surrounding 
  the fort which effected its future use so a few years later the fort was burned 
  and the area was replanted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on my memory of the general location and an old aerial photograph of the fort, I located the fort on map and obtained coordinates. I was able to locate burnt posts and all four corners.  Overall size of the fort was about 200 by 225 feet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is in an ammo can a short distance from the fort’s location. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waypoint 1.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
From the starting coordinates find the closest power pole.  There is a 7-digit number on the pole. &lt;br&gt;
V = first 4 digits&lt;br&gt;
W = last 3 digits&lt;br&gt;
AAA = V-872&lt;br&gt;
BBB =W-163 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Most of the year there are a myriad of oppurtunties to enjoy this park when there are craft and antique shows, camping, and other festivals.  You also might enjoy the other times of the year, when the park offers a quiet refuge from the busy world. 

You are looking for a small container that is CLEARLY marked with identifiable markings.  You may want to bring your own writing implement!

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Cache is in an ammo can .10 miles off the Edison trail that wraps along the north shore of the lake. A small amount of tree hoppng might be needed after leaving the trail. Just stick to the shoreline.

The name of the cache comes from a bigeddy cache I stumbled across while walking the dogs near Bend. It must have been found and moved by some kids. After contacting the owner to give it back, he said it was okay to keep it and place it somewhere else. The name of his cache was "Enter the Dragon or..." (GC1FDBV). Hence the name.

Enjoy the view!</groundspeak:long_description>

Grabbed this one along the way on our first walk here today. This was one of our favorite locations on the hike. We stopped to relax a bit and watch the bald eagle fly around over the lake.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;i&gt;She eventually made it from the

&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;i&gt;In the &lt;b&gt;WEST&lt;/b&gt; she took to
stealin’ cache,&lt;br /&gt;
To pay for her longin’ for minty stash.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The law caught up with Missus
Dale,&lt;br /&gt;
But she knew she couldn’t post the bail.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;i&gt;She’d thought to start over in
this small town,&lt;br /&gt;
But found the Altoid Tins kept her down.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The minty drops were still
a’callin’,&lt;br /&gt;
Which left poor Martha screamin’ and bawlin’.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;i&gt;She stole now from her neighbor
Sue,&lt;br /&gt;
And her past caught up with her anew.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The rope was swingin’ on the

Must have just left before the TBirds showed up as their names weren't on the log when I signed it. Quite ironic that we both showed up on the same day after the length of time this one had not been found. Made it a favorite for this puzzle series. TFTH. SL</groundspeak:text>

As have others, we decided to do this one clockwise starting with Lava 14.  After completing the loop around the lake, we are glad we chose that route since the bushwhacking from 5 to 6 could have been a bit discouraging to continue.  All caches were found in good shape and right where the coords took us (except for Lava 15 and we will note further information in that log).  The trek through the marsh grasses was not a problem (even for 1/2zip) but you did have to watch your step here and there as it is clear waterfowl and elk use this area frequently.  It could not have been a better day with temperatures in the mid-70's and the skeeters nowhere to be found.  Very enjoyable and challenging series that we are glad to have behind us.

What a beautiful day to be out Geocaching on lava Lake. We hiked about 5 miles and were able to snag 1 FTF.  

We walked clockwise around the lake and we are glad we did. The first few caches are quite a bushwhack over a lot of fallen trees.  We noticed that GC33KEA in the same area has the terrain at 3 1/2.  We would say that that is a good number :) for 6 through 11.

We had a blast, and again, thank you Sea Flyer for putting these out.

Geocaching the world one cache at a time
May the wind always be at your back and the sun shine warm upon your face.
TFTC!

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Long ago, in a kingdom of the North, an aging ruler, approaching
death by Degrees, and his beautiful daughters, took a visitor. It
was he, Nebuchadnezzar, three times victorious, and he took one
away. Minutes later, a babylonian, one-fifth of Solomon's value,
raised a point.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"Imperial greatness..." quoth he.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"What follows?" growled the king.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"Nebuchadnezzar, five times magnificent... we have come to an end
of the beginning of our tale."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;hr align="center" width="20%" size="5" color="purple" /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Years later, in the West, began another tale, and we hear the
Degrees of its progression with interest. In it, Balthazar, and a
councilor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"My king," quoth the latter, "a man from your retinue. Shall I add
this one to you?"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"Nay, he shall follow instead," replied the ruler. "In a few
Minutes, he may attend. Who is he, pray, councilor? Might it be
Melchior and small Jeroboam together?"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"Signs seem to Point that way, my king," the councilor spoke.
"Additionally, there is great Milchizedek; three times he comes,
followed by a man a third of Methuselah's number."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"Ah..." sighed the king. "Truly, then, we have come to the end of
our tale."&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">This replaces the original Third Butte cache which disappeared. The small container is well hidden in a new location. Bring small trade items. If the cache is rehidden properly, &lt;b&gt;you do not need to move any rocks or vegetation to find it.&lt;/b&gt; Short off-trail scramble. Please rehide out of sight.
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Overturf Butte is the third and smallest butte in Bend. There is a small city-owned open space on top and a water tank and picnic area just below the summit. It can be reached by several trails from surrounding streets such as Flagline Drive near NW Galveston Avenue. The summit and the cache are a brief walk from several directions such as the trailhead on Flagline Dr. off Skyliners Rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overturf Butte (3909 ft) is about 1.3 mi from the south summit of Awbrey Butte and 1.8 mi from the higher north summit (4225 ft). It is about 3 mi from Pilot Butte (4138 ft) to the east. A sign at the top marks the location of a 1946 forest lookout. Today, there are good views of downtown and the developing Mill District. Ten years ago there was hardly a house to be seen near Overturf. Now, they are climbing up on all sides. The area is heavily used so be a sneaky geocacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always your help would be appreciated to keep the area clean of trash and broken glass. Bring gloves and a bag. There's a trash can below the water tanks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Fun to bike to with a mountain bike. Close to Bluegrass Loop in
crossroads, but I don't know if it is possible to get to it from
there without owning a house so that you can go out the back way.
The difficulty varies with how you get there. There are trails
either way.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;There are some road intersections near here. See Google Maps for
more information. To get to this on a bicycle from downtown
Sisters, come down highway 242 and look for Edgington road on the
left. When you get there, there should be a dirt trail that runs
parallel to the highway for a short length (but not seeable from it
because of trees) like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="margin: 1.5em;"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
   Path --&amp;gt; |  |&lt;br /&gt;            |  |&lt;br /&gt;Edgington   |  | &amp;lt;-- 242&lt;br /&gt;------------|--|
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0;"&gt;After you are on the bike path, use your
GPS to get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a "power line" road that crosses 242 that you can
walk or bike from.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">While we are enjoying a week at the Lava Lake Resort we had to give this series a look-see.  As have others, we decided to do this one clockwise starting with Lava 14.  After completing the loop around the lake, we are glad we chose that route since the bushwhacking from 5 to 6 could have been a bit discouraging to continue.  All caches were found in good shape and right where the coords took us (except for Lava 15 and we will note further information in that log).  The trek through the marsh grasses was not a problem (even for 1/2zip) but you did have to watch your step here and there as it is clear waterfowl and elk use this area frequently.  It could not have been a better day with temperatures in the mid-70's and the skeeters nowhere to be found.  Very enjoyable and challenging series that we are glad to have behind us.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Wow. Well, I couldn't find a closer road to this one, so I bushwhacked over a tenth of a mile through obstructions of bush and branch. The search at GZ took a small while, since the coords jumped a bit hither and yon, but then I put the GPSr aside and looked for visual clues. Found the cache shortly thereafter. OK, now how do I get back? Luckily I had remembered to take a waypoint at my car, and whaddayaknow, I hiked over a ridge and there was my car, right in front of me. I really like it when that happens. TNLS</groundspeak:text>

Our goal was to find all his caches south of Hwy 242 by riding our bicycles to the cache sites.  All afternoon we struggled with inexact coords, but we still managed to find 21 Sea Flyer caches plus 3 others.

This was yet another bushwhack off the nearest road.  Stashed the bikes and hiked.  Found it.  Thanks!</groundspeak:text>

This is the hill with all the communications towers in the northwest part of the city. Start at Sylvan or Summit Park and walk uphill, some of it moderately steep.
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The closest approach is from Sylvan Park to the north (a small neighborhood park at N 44° 04.762' W 121° 20.075'). Head south, up hill and to the west of the chain link fence. Avoid nearby residences. The site is usually accessible except during heavy snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a longer stroll (about a half mile), park to the east at Summit Park (N 44° 04.522' W 121° 19.662') and take the trail from the parking lot around the north side of the butte. Follow the trail along the chain link fence to near Sylvan Park and continue up hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not approach from the south up the paved access road because a fence (new as of 7/22/05) will block your way to the cache. There is no way around the fence without trespassing on private property.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Since you can't place caches in caves this proved the next best thing for a ring depository. See if you can find the one ring to rule them all! Fun location but not for the faint of heart or for that matter the claustrophobic. Should accommodate most adults and children. Be sure and avail yourself of the other nearby caches, that's how I found this spot in the first place and now you can try for the bonus (GC57G90) by solving the field puzzle located at this cache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always cache in trash out! Be safe, don't do anything you don't feel comfortable with and good luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. I would love feedback on the helpfulness of hints, the accuracy of ratings or anything else that you can think of that would improve the experience for those after you&lt;/p&gt;

As we approached the cache site a hawk was circling really low and giving us the eyeball, think we were trespassing on his turf. Took a few minutes for my GPS to settle, but then it was a fairly quick find with great coords. The views were awesome! I'm definitely working on my fear of heights one cache at a time. Thanks so much for putting these out, markellie!</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">FTF - Little story of our adventure: drove in on some rugged dirt roads. Had to move some fallen timber to continue on one of these roads. Ended the driving portion when the fallen timber was waaaay to big to move. Hike on said road for a short bit. Descend down to the river, but have to do so upstream of cache because the manzanita is thick &amp; delicious. Stumble downstream. Get wet &amp; find the cache!

Reverse the above steps. Back at the car &amp; realize the gas light is on. Uh oh... Drive out on a different dirt road in hopes of saving fuel. Come to a closed gate, but only feet from our exit. We were closed in on the closed road; not closed out. Oh boy! Shenanigans for the next 15 minutes. And home safely with a couple drops of fuel to spare.

This is an awesome cache. Well done! TFTC</groundspeak:text>

HOOT! placed this cache in a fairly unknown piece of BLM land off of Fryrear Rd. A series of night caches by HOOT! HOOT!-IV  Park at the parking coords listed below and then walk a short bit south along the dirt road to the beginning of the night cache. Be sure and check out the other HOOT! HOOT! night caches in the area....</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">You will need a high powered flashlight, preferably a LED one that puts off a good beam. Put the flashlight at your eye level and shine 360 degrees around you and a reflection will come back. Keep going until you reach a red reflection and the ammo container will be in a 15' radius.
There will be six white and one red- so a fairly quick night cache.

There are no canyons to decend or accend. 

This is not too hard of a night cache for those that have done night caches. Try this on a bright moon night and see the mountains to the west.Grandma lived way past these mountains, but she always enjoyed visiting us here in Central Oregon with the great mountain views that we all share. She lived in Manzanita on the coast.  So that is why there are sea shells in this cache. I ask you to bring tradable items that are coast related, or to leave items that remind you of the coast in remembrance of grandma. We put grandmas cache on a knoll with good views of the mountains, day or night.  Cheers- and happy night caching...

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Reason number 112 for living in Central Oregon:  warm, sunny days in January that encourage us to get out of the house.  This was one of those days and with the extended forcast looking good...we decided to place a cache to celebrate.  We loaded up some tupperware with a few items you might want to take along to the river and dropped it in the woods near the Deschutes.  Being a Skadog however, this is not going to be your typical Sunriver area "grab and go," but it doesn't have to be difficult either.  At the listed coordinates you will...some of you will find the coordinates for the cache which is less than .21 away, so whether it takes you five minutes or five hours, just depends on how you look at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

Made it today thinking that the only way in would be from the Benham falls road. Slopped our way through the back roads, zig-zagging our way to the first waypoint. Got all the way to the river then strapped on our cleats and headed off. Found the invisable wp fairly quickly. Gave up on the GPS and searched for the final high and low... it magicly appeared after sitting relaxing, and enjoying the view!  On the way out we decided to go the other way because of the  amount of tracks on the road, which lead us to the easy way out in record time, figures. TFTMC SL</groundspeak:text>

As have others, we decided to do this one clockwise starting with Lava 14.  After completing the loop around the lake, we are glad we chose that route since the bushwhacking from 5 to 6 could have been a bit discouraging to continue.  All caches were found in good shape and right where the coords took us (except for Lava 15 and we will note further information in that log).  The trek through the marsh grasses was not a problem (even for 1/2zip) but you did have to watch your step here and there as it is clear waterfowl and elk use this area frequently.  It could not have been a better day with temperatures in the mid-70's and the skeeters nowhere to be found.  Very enjoyable and challenging series that we are glad to have behind us.

The trail will cross a small road and continues past the bridge. Please do not go on the bridge as it is private property.

To find the cache you will notice a number on the tag. Simply continue along the trail that many feet from the waypoint. The cache is hidden six feet below a rather unique ponderosa tree.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I decided I wanted to get out and do something a little more challenging today.  I had wanted to do these for some time and there was no better day than today.  I hiked all the way to Private Bridge and did the caches along the river on the way back.  The only one I did on the way was the multi cache because I would have to backtrack to get it done.  I scrambled across the boulder field on the way and soon found the little red flags.  The little red flag trail was pretty good.  I definitely got off trail a few times but seeing the flags always got me back on trail.  I highly recommend using the red flag trail.  I think they might have plans to extend the trail as there has been some substantial clearing past the last cache.  Anyway, the red flag trail was easier to use on the way back.  It goes a lot higher on the boulder field and its a little less of a scramble.  It was a beautiful hike.  The scenery was amazing.  I was on trail by 10:00 and there was hardly anyone else around.  The weather climbed into the sixties and there was not a cloud to be seen.  Thanks to all that put these caches out.  I appreciate the Smilies!!

I didn't have any trouble locating the first waypoint.  It is in fine shape and is still readable despite a little pitch dripping over it.  I located the cache in fine condition and still hidden well.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">SSC Blaze and I finally had a chance to head out in our "backyard" We decided that since we hiked the Metolius-Windigo Trail the Tahoe Rim Trail and the Three Sisters Loop Trail last summer that we need to get our feet/bodies in shape for another summer of hiking. Why not create some trails in the BLM area? This will not be the only "Days Hike" in the area. You will see more this summer. Be sure and check out the NEW "A Nights Hike" night caching adventure nearby. "A Days Hike" is a series of fairly easy caches that you will need to write down the word, number or digits to solve the "A Day Hike" Puzzle cache- 15 all together... This is a long hike in BLM land that traverses running trails, horse trails, atv trails and old canal trails. Elkjim registered over 11 miles doing this cache. There is some cross country traveling, about 10-15%, but for the most part you are better off to stay on designated trails, roads or paths. Good Luck and do not forget to write down the taped word, digit or number to solve the PUZZLE...

Some of you may recognize this area as I did some MBS Caches a couple years ago. Bring lots of water and plan about 4 hours plus-But you will log many caches and enjoy the views, sights, sounds and the wonder of the high desert. Check the area for other caches created by other geo-cachers before heading out and if you have never done any caches in this area you could log 25+ caches in a half day...

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">A new night cache in a little known piece of BLM
A series of night caches by HOOT! HOOT!- I</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I decided to do this night cache after doing the one on Pine Mountain in May 2009. I decided on the name after my son-the fuzzz- purchased a small stuffed owl named HOOT in Steamboat Springs in June 2009. While I was placing this cache I could hear a HOOT HOOT in the distance and maybe you will too. 

I went out and placed this ammo container under almost full moonlight with a little snow on the ground. I was able to see very well, even without a flashlight. I used a Mag-Lite flashlight to re-check the placement of the deflectors. I also was carrying a halogen flashlight. I could see the markers alright with the halogen, but much, much better with the mag lite. I would recommend a flashlight that has a high and long beam. You must hold the flashlight at eye level and scan the horizon for a reflector-marker. Then proceed to that marker. Round trip is only about 1/4 of a mile.

There is a code to the markers/reflectors: 

Two stacked on top- means to look behind marker and continue in the same direction.

Two side by side- means to look in a Southerly-left direction.

Three side by side - means to look in a Northerly-right direction.

When you find the red deflector-marker you are within a 10-15 foot radius of the final container- 

The above coordinates will take you to where you will need to stand and scan the horizon in a NW direction to obtain the first marker-deflectors.

Good luck finding this cache. The terrain rating is a three because of the night difficulty and there are rocks and some sage brush in the area.

Happy caching

** I had so much fun placing this one that I placed another night cache in the nearby vicinity- You can call HOOT! HOOT! a warm up to the new A NEW YEARS DAY NIGHT CACHE- HOOT! HOOT!-RETURNS -placed 1-1-2010.**

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">While we are enjoying a week at the Lava Lake Resort we had to give this series a look-see.  As have others, we decided to do this one clockwise starting with Lava 14.  After completing the loop around the lake, we are glad we chose that route since the bushwhacking from 5 to 6 could have been a bit discouraging to continue.  All caches were found in good shape and right where the coords took us (except for Lava 15 and we will note further information in that log).  The trek through the marsh grasses was not a problem (even for 1/2zip) but you did have to watch your step here and there as it is clear waterfowl and elk use this area frequently.  It could not have been a better day with temperatures in the mid-70's and the skeeters nowhere to be found.  Very enjoyable and challenging series that we are glad to have behind us.

A small cache in the base of a mighty tree. Leave the lake behind
you, find a huge fallen tree. Climb on the roots, look down the
tree, turn your eyes towards 2:00 o'clock and you shall find the
cache in the base of another tree, maybe 35 paces off your current
vantage point. EDIT: 7/9/6 - changed feet to paces, thanks ajgray.</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Solved this puzzle a long while ago and finally decided to get it today, well after the rain and terrifying weather decided to end anyways. Was a nice hike to the cache, if a little wet every time something brushed against us [:)] and I thought it was going to be a shorter trip but the gate was closed due to fire danger so the hike turned into something a little longer but there was pizza waiting for us when we got home which made everything better. The sky was just gorgeous that day. Plus I got a waterproof match container in trade from the cache which I will repurpose as another cache [:D] nice little circle of geocaching life moment.

No trees were killed to send this message, but a large number of electrons were terribly inconvenienced

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I solved the puzzle from southern Oregon, and found the final today with daveydude and BIGGIEET_AL. After a long day of caching in central Oregon, we got to the trail-head just in time to do the 1.5mile round-trip hike and get back to the rig before they locked the gate a dusk. The last part of the hike was a little steep, but daveydude walked right to the cache and pulled it out, like he was the one who hid it! We were pleased to spot it so quickly, especially since it hadn't been found since last summer. It survived the winter and is in fine shape. This was one of six cache types we found today; personal records for all three of us. Thanks for contributing to our adventures! Definitely a favorite!

P.S. Didn't see any trackables in the cache. I was hoping to log the "Golden Man" travel bug, but no such luck.</groundspeak:text>

Once at the site take a little time to explore. There is a point of interest at N 44.55.319 / W 121.27.023 called Cinder Station. Hunt around the bushes a bit and you will find some survey markers and tree tags having to do with Sunriver back in 1972. You can also hook up with a nice horse/bike trail that comes from Benham Falls all the way to Sunriver, if you look slightly north of the cache.

On the under side of the ammo can lid are coordinates for a bonus cache called "Grey Burp Bonus". The coords are also listed on the front and back pages of the log book.

Found the cache and entered the coords for the bonus into the GPS and off we went back towards the truck. We loaded up and were ready to go, and wouldn't you know it, the GPS crashed. Got it rebooted but it lost the bonus cache coords. We made our way to the general area, I think, but came from a direction that left a whole sea of manzanita to be waded through. Already bloodied from some other trailmaking, we decided to postpone the bonus until we can go back and get the coords. And, I will be sure to write them on some good old fashioned reliable paper next time. Thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

However, you can't drive to the gate anymore and the road is very faint until you get passed some barriers.  Just makes it a long walk and more cross country until you find the road.  Once you find the road you will find the Gate.

 To do the long hike, continue north on the PCT through Sawyer Bar,
Opie Dildock Pass, and Minnie Scott Spring. Catch trail 3531 west
and walk past Four In One Cone back to the highway. More than worth
the extra steps required. The views are unforgettable.&lt;br&gt;

 Near the trail(s) there are three memorial plaques. &lt;br&gt;
You will be looking for them to gather some information.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 The &lt;b&gt;Prouty Plaque&lt;/b&gt; located near 44 10.623 121 49.037&lt;br&gt;
The &lt;b&gt;Montague Plaque&lt;/b&gt; located near 44 10.201 121 49.522.&lt;br&gt;
 The &lt;b&gt;Bronaugh Plaque&lt;/b&gt; located near 44 10.621 121 49.048.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 At some point you will pass Obsidian Falls, you will need to
&lt;b&gt;post a picture of your team with the falls in the
background.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
On your way out, you will find the cache using the following simple
formulas. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;ABC&lt;/b&gt; = (Richard's Age + Jerry's Age + Harley's Age)*3 +11&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;DEF&lt;/b&gt; = (Richard's Age + Jerry's Age + Jerry's Age + Harley's
Age)&lt;br&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I had a very good military buddy come over for a visit from Florida and wanted to take him on an amazing hike while he was here.  I thought this would fit the bill nicely.  We started early and made the hike easily.  One group of older folks in the Limited Access Area with us and other than our time on the Pacific Crest Trail, they were the only other people we saw on those trails.  The Pacific Crest Trail was another matter altogether.  Lots and lots of people hiking the trail.  At Obsidian Falls, we ran into a young man from Germany that had started it in Mexico.  At the highest point of the trail we were on, we ran into two guys and one of them was naked except for his hiking boots.  He was modest enough to cover himself in the important areas with a large floppy hat as he passed.  Lots of pictures taken and exceptional views were taken in all around.  We made it to the bottom again and I attempted several times to do the math from looking at the pics on my camera.  No matter what I tried, it wasn't to be on that particular trip.  I have since got the coordinates right and will go out to sign the cache log.   Thanks for an amazing experience and a perfect hike to take along a good friend on.  An extra special Smiley was earned this day!

Made it back on 08/03/15 to sign the log.  Thanks again for the hunt!!

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Sure glad to be invited along on this adventure.  The trail is very well maintained with a pleasantly gradual grade all the way up.  Due to the clouds, which became fog at the top, we had spotty views of the North Sister.  The lighting at the top was amazing, in between fog movements,  and made all the colors pop.  The obsidian field was wondrous and the little circular puddles of crystal clear water astonishing.   This day hike is simply a must do.  We got the exact coordinates and found the ammunition can safely nestled in its hiding spot below a fallen tree.  2 years lonley cache [:d] - Favorite point added - TFTCTNLNsl</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">The drive to Frog Camp is about one hour from Bend.  We left Bailey at home, as she is 14+ and had figured our 5:45 am departure from home was not to her liking.  

Met up with the rest of the team and headed out just short of 0700am in the persistent showers; we had pretty steady rain up until 1120am.  The drippy overcast cancelled out any views of the nearby scenery.  Arrived at the Montague Plaque 0941 and the other two about an hour later.  

This is an epic hike and we hope the cache has a long life and many visits.  The checksum is 42, as noted by Bubblegummers.  BaileyBellaBC

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Had a great time, except for the weather (no good views), finding this cache with Bubblegummers, Kestrel Ridge, and Globaltreckers.  Guess I need to come back on a better day to see the sights we missed.  Had off and on drizzle and low fog for most of the day.  Didn't have a lot of other hikers on the trail today and got to see a nice buck before we got to the trailhead.  Thanks for putting this great cache out for us to find.  You guys need to team up and put another one like this one out soon.  T4TH</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Have had this cache on my bucket list for some time. Put together a group and we made the hike early this morning. Weather was overcast and drippy to start but we finally found sun for a brief period when we got on top. Had a little trouble spotting the Bronaugh plaque but finally made the find. Computed the coordinates and off to the final we went. Great idea for the layout of this cache. Hiked about 13 miles in 6:49 with total ascent of 2,356 ft. Even with all the elevation gain, the hike was quite pleasurable as there were virtually no long, steep uphill climbs. Thanks again to Elkjim, Kestrel Ridge and Globaltreckers for joining me on the hike. Will make it a favorite when I have another favorite point go give. TFTH. TN L Bubblegummers Card #16,658 SL
